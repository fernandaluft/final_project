The President's Assassin,"In 48 hours, the U.S. President will be history. ""Haig...never fail[s] to keep us on our toes."" - Booklist It looked like a mass execution: six people, systematically shot and killed in a private Washington mansion. One of the targets happened to be the White House Chief of Staff. But that wasn't the reason Sean Drummond was called in on the case. Newly enlisted in a CIA cell called the Office of Special Projects, the former Army lawyer was informed that the murders were just a warning. The killer had left a note: ""You can't stop us. There will be others, and the President will be history in the next two days."" The clock is ticking. The hunt begins for the ultimate killer-for-hire-a brilliant, coldhearted professional with an insider's knowledge of Washington. For Sean Drummond, it's the greatest challenge of his career, a terrifying cat-and-mouse game with unthinkable consequences. If he fails, the world will never be the same-and one calculating killer will collect the $100 million bounty on the President's head. The story of one shocking conspiracy, two fateful days, and an earth-shattering death threat, THE PRESIDENT'S ASSASSIN is a gripping and chillingly real novel from one of the world's premier writers.",['Brian Haig'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=R9GC0a3F4o8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=R9GC0a3F4o8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+President%27s+Assassin&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vision,2007-12-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=R9GC0a3F4o8C&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],4.0,1415918031,,A232IOL4QP8EML,Gozfordpark,1/2,5.0,1109203200,I loved this book..,"A friend of mine gave me a copy of this book. I had never read any of the writers books before and so I found myself happily surprised when I could not put it down.I read the entire book in one night!The suspense aspect is so well written that it reads like non-fiction and the writers style of humor- sly, dry and witty is very funny indeed. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I highly recommend this and feel as though I've discovered the next Nelson De Mille."

Dialogs are really unnatural (I recall a conversation about one of victims immediately after his death which was just too witty to be real) and some words are used too often. There are pages where the author starts using some expression and simply cannot quit it: in reality, actually, incidentally are a few examples. They pop up every other sentence.I am sticking to the book only because of the excellent narration by Scott Brick (this refers to the audio version)."
SOUNDER,"This powerful Newbery-winning classic tells the story of the great coon dog Sounder and his family. An African American boy and his family rarely have enough to eat. Each night, the boy's father takes their dog, Sounder, out to look for food. The man grows more desperate by the day. When food suddenly appears on the table one morning, it seems like a blessing. But the sheriff and his deputies are not far behind. The ever-loyal Sounder remains determined to help the family he loves as hard times bear down. This classic novel shows the courage, love, and faith that bind a family together despite the racism and inhumanity they face in the nineteenth-century deep South. Readers who enjoy timeless dog stories such as Old Yeller and Where the Red Fern Grows will find much to love in Sounder, even as they read through tears at times.",['William H.

I have only two minor suggestions for &quot;Classic Roses&quot; if it is once again revised: include U.S.A. climate zones for the roses; include photographs of all (not most) of the roses (I'll bet the author wanted to do this and the publishers wouldn't let him).As fond as I am of my friend, &quot;Classic Roses&quot; and I are never going to part company."

Education of a wandering man,"From his decision to leave school at fifteen to roam the world, to his recollections of life as a hobo on the Southern Pacific Railroad, as a cattle skinner in Texas, as a merchant seaman in Singapore and the West Indies, and as an itinerant bare-knuckled prizefighter across small-town America, here is Louis L'Amour's memoir of his lifelong love affair with learning—from books, from yondering, and from some remarkable men and women—that shaped him as a storyteller and as a man. Like classic L'Amour fiction, Education of a Wandering Man mixes authentic frontier drama--such as the author's desperate efforts to survive a sudden two-day trek across the blazing Mojave desert--with true-life characters like Shanghai waterfront toughs, desert prospectors, and cowboys whom Louis L'Amour met while traveling the globe. At last, in his own words, this is a story of a one-of-a-kind life lived to the fullest . . . a life that inspired the books that will forever enable us to relive our glorious frontier heritage.","[""Louis L'Amour""]",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x_4j_vuDHp0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=x_4j_vuDHp0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Education+of+a+wandering+man&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam,2008-04-29,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x_4j_vuDHp0C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],26.0,B0006RWJGK,,A29IEWBQHSVOY3,charles@runels.com,2/2,5.0,919814400,Wish I would have had this book when I was 15,"Do you want inspiration concerning the building of your own education?

Gethers' writing sings, with lots of comedy and literary references as he uses his relationship with his Scottish Fold, Norton, as a wonderful excuse to make observations on the social habits of New Yorker, Parisians, Californians and others, and on the power of cute, furry creatures as chick bait. An easy but intelligent read, this is a great book for anyone appreciates cats or skillful writing."
It Can't Happen Here (Audio Book),"“What makes Trump immune is that he is not a president within the context of a healthy Republican government. He is a cult leader of a movement that has taken over a political party – and he specifically campaigned on a platform of one-man rule. This fact permeates “Can It Happen Here? . . . which concludes, if you read between the lines, that “it” already has.” – New York Times Book Review ""Several of the contributors...agree that American politics is susceptible to creeping authoritarianism and provide the intellectual underpinning."" – Washington Post With the election of Donald J. Trump, many people on both the left and right feared that America’s 240-year-old grand experiment in democracy was coming to an end, and that Sinclair Lewis’ satirical novel, It Can’t Happen Here, written during the dark days of the 1930s, could finally be coming true. Is the democratic freedom that the United States symbolizes really secure? Can authoritarianism happen in America? Acclaimed legal scholar, Harvard Professor, and New York Times bestselling author Cass R. Sunstein queried a number of the nation’s leading thinkers. In this thought-provoking collection of essays, these distinguished thinkers and theorists explore the lessons of history, how democracies crumble, how propaganda works, and the role of the media, courts, elections, and ""fake news"" in the modern political landscape—and what the future of the United States may hold.

Blankenship,6/6,5.0,1158796800,THIS IS NOT UNCLE WALT'S VERSION,"I love this work. This of course the the story that was made into the now classic animated Disney film. This not not like the Disney film at all. Now I am rather fond of the film and can remember my mother taking it to it shortly after the war (WWII) and of course have since taken my children and grandchildren to see the same. This book/story though, is far superior in my opinion. Actually, read as an adult, it is quite profound, dealing with quite a number of issues. Relationships between parent and child, child and peers and nature and man. I do not feel you can classify this work as an antihunting story. It more or less puts and keeps man in his place in the big picture of things, for better or for worse. Like another reviewer, I was particularly fascinated with Bambi's friend who became a ""pet of man."" There is a lesson here as to following ones nature. I am not sure I completely understand the message, but know it is there. Yes, this work does deal with death and dying and yes there is sad parts. I personally don't feel children should be sheltered from such things completely as they all will eventually have to face the same feelings and dilemmas. I hate to use the word ""classic"" as it is quite often over used, but know of no other way to describe this one. I do highly recommend it."
The Blue Bottle Club,,,,,,,,,,0849937809,,,,0/0,4.0,938390400,An interesting account of renewed friendships,"Penelope Stokes' characters captured my attention from the beginning. The author made me care about what happened to each one of her characters. My only reservation about the story was the fact that of six women who were major players in the book, only one of them had a positive, important romantic relationship in her life and even that came late in life and was rather short-lived. To me that seemed very unrealistic. However, the book was well-written and kept my interest to the end."
Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life,"Joe DiMaggio was, at every turn, one man we could look at who made us feel good. In the hard-knuckled thirties, he was the immigrant boy who made it big—and spurred the New York Yankees to a new era of dynasty. He was Broadway Joe, the icon of elegance, the man who wooed and won Marilyn Monroe—the most beautiful girl America could dream up. Joe DiMaggio was a mirror of our best self. And he was also the loneliest hero we ever had. In this groundbreaking biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Richard Ben Cramer presents a shocking portrait of a complicated, enigmatic life. The story that DiMaggio never wanted told, tells of his grace—and greed; his dignity, pride—and hidden shame.

Fisher,1/1,4.0,1250380800,Unflattering portrait of a great ballplayer,"This is an excellent biography overall. I got the feeling it was extremely well researched and well written, and I learned a lot about Joe DiMaggio, ""the greatest ballplayer who ever lived,"" as he liked to be called.But the picture painted by Richard Ben Cramer is not pretty to look at. Joltin' Joe was, it appears, a money-grubbing skinflint who expected people to give him everything for free and immediately became suspicious and cut people off as soon as they asked for the smallest thing in return. He cut off his son, who later died of a crank overdose, for not living up to his standards. He lost two wives, including Marilyn Monroe, essentially because he was so controlling and domineering. Although he managed to patch things up with one of his brothers, Dom, he basically died alone under the effective control of a lawyer who was out to get everything he could from the DiMaggio estate.I didn't doubt this picture as presented by the author, but I felt there must be something missing. Late in his life, he was a very popular social fixture on the New York scene, hanging out with a lot of luminaries such as Woody Allen, Paul Simon and Henry Kissinger, to name a few. I found it hard to reconcile Cramer's picture of DiMaggio as, well, a jerk, with the apparent fact that he was a popular social butterfly late in life.It seemed to me that he must have had a charming side too, or he wouldn't have been so popular. But there was little suggestion in the book that Joe could be charming. That's why I gave this book four stars instead of five -- that feeling that something must be missing. Still, it's a great book and a great read. Highly recommended for baseball fans."

First of all, it's hard to believe one thing in this book because Cramer doesn't give a source. I could write a book about how Lou Gehrig was a womanizing racist using quotes from unnamed sources, but that doesn't mean a word of it is true. I'm not saying that Mr. DiMaggio was a saint but this book tries to make him out to be a spawn of Satan. Lastly, I find it funny that one of the editor's said this book was ""elegantly"" written. Elegantly? Using racial slurs is elegant? Don't waste your money on this trash."

Having lived at least some of my life in the deep south, most of the characters seemed real, although others, like Coach Schuler, seemed a bit too unrealistic to me, especially in some of the ways he treats his football team.

Global Warming and Other Eco Myths: How the Environmental Movement Uses False Science to Scare Us to Death,"Includes essays by Nobel Laureate Dr. Norman E. Borlaug and other noted scientists and scholars The modern environmental movement began with the publication of three seminal works, Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring, Paul Ehrlich's ""The Population Bomb, and the Club of Rome's ""The Limits to Growth. These books' dismal visions of a poisoned, over-populated, resource-depleted world spiraling down toward environmental collapse are today's conventional wisdom. And every year we hear about new ""conclusive"" reports from special interest groups claiming that our atmosphere's temperatures are soaring, our air and water are more polluted, our cities are more crowded, and our global food supply is more precarious than ever before. However, according to a number of leading scientists from around the world, members of the environmental movement are guilty of twisting--sometimes manufacturing--the facts in an effort to frighten people into joining their cause. In this eye-opening book, some of the most respected researchers in the country explode the myths behind much of the doom and gloom of today's environmental movement. You will discover how the hysteria about global warming, overpopulation, mass extinctions, imminent famines, biotechnology, energy shortages, and more are grounded not in reason but in false science and a fear of progress. When placed beside the overwhelming facts, some of the most pervasive eco-myths crumble, including: Myth: Antarctica is melting due to global warming--threatening to raise ocean levels Fact: Antarctica has been cooling--and its glaciers thickening--for the past 30 years Myth: The global population is growing faster than our ability toproduce food Fact: Global fertility rates are falling dramatically, and with advanced technology, farmers are producing more food using fewer resources than ever before Myth: Solar- and wind-powered generators are a renewable, efficient, and less intrusive alternative to gas-, oil-, and coal-burning generators Fact: Global fossil fuel supplies are in no near-term danger of being depleted, and a single 555-megawatt natural gas power plant produces more electricity than 13,000 windmills Myth: Modern pesticides and fertilizers are increasing the rates of cancer in humans Fact: No study has ever shown that anyone has developed cancer from the legal application of pesticides, and environmental pollution accounts for at most 2 percent of all cancer cases versus 30 percent caused by tobacco use And many more Ultimately, this book shows that uniting much of the environmental movement is an agenda that is not so much anti-pollution as it is anti-human.

It gives them an edge over unrepentent companies like Exxon for one! Environmentalism is now a huge industry itself, $4 biliion a year in the US and $8 billion yearly world wide.

Good combination. The book obviously astounds one with its lustrous knowledge about western classical music as Seth himself states &quot;music to me is dearer than speech.&quot; A book about love, loss, mystifying pain, frustration, joy and then love regained.Michael, the narrator, and the depressed violinist leads a nonexistent life till he spots Julia in a London bus. It is a book where Julia sees herself as one with her music except that the only music she can hear is in her mind. Slowly secret visits, candid lies and sly deceit takes over for their amour. Michael thinks he has found happiness again-when he is in her blissful company and Julia finds solace and a companion for her music.

Its like this. It follows a pattern. Over hyped. After the stellar success of A Suitable Boy-this book, you see, just had to be a success. It just couldn't be any other way. Even if the theme or the main content was ordinary and funnily enough basic the publishers have to make it look like a dancing queen of all the other pouts of literature that have been trickling slowly encompassing the Indian subcontinent when it comes to writing in Englished. It is like a psychological blob that has been fixated in the minds of us audiences who just obliviously become the naive scapegoats to be bludgeoned by the &quot;astounding&quot; books. It flows through the continuum flux of overrated books. The book albeit, much sought out for is very staid. Very metered. It comes from the mind of a literary superstar who stands at the pinnacle of his achievements. He's a smart bloke with a musical ear.

Broesche,2/2,5.0,1334966400,"an elegant lesson regarding the ""condition of music""","I read this novel many years ago and loved it. It has been one of my favorites ever since, although I recognize that it might be a difficult read for someone not seriously interested in music.I picked it up this afternoon, really just killing time, to read again the last two pages, especially the last paragraph. I think that this is the most elegant ending of any novel I have ever read. It never fails to touch me.Walter Pater, a 19th century British critic, made a famous statement: ""All art aspires to the condition of music."" By this, Pater meant that music touches us emotionally more directly than any other art medium. Psychologically, one can say that we hear music and directly experience it. We do not have to think about it, analyze it -- let our rationality critique that experience before we react. Rather, music's enjoyment is immediate, emotional, and visceral. To be trite, ""it speaks to us"" directly through our unconscious mind without mediation of our conscious intellect. Pater, who was a literary and art critic, was saying that all other art forms aspire to this condition -- to ""speak"" just as directly, immediately, and to have unmediated impact upon the viewer, reader, recipient of the work of art -- to rise to this condition of music.In my view, the final paragraph of this book is the novelist's statement of the same sentiment. It is a visceral, elegant statement of music's potential unmediated impact upon the human soul. For me, it is as if the entire novel was preparation for this simple ending paragraph. The title to the book and its use in the novel's ending, reinforces my sense of this. For this lovely ending alone, I would recommend this novel to anyone who has experienced the exhilaration that music can provide. Haven't we all?"

Admittedly, it can be just a little confusing in some places, but there are very few classics that can be read in one sitting and completely understood. One of the best stories, and my personal favorite, is &quot;The Veldt&quot; because virtual reality is no longer the sci-fi topic it was when this story was written. This makes the story all the more chilling, especially considering all the time kids spend in front of the computer and tv! All in all, this is one of the best books I have ever read, and I would recommend it to just about anyone over the age of 12 or 13."
The Climate : A Perspective Unvisited,"Heres a fascinating new book which answers the question not many have asked, ""Where did racism come from and why, the heck, is it still here?"" Pearl Jr. asked this question to herself 30 years ago and has utilized her lifetime to seek the answers. She says, ""this is a book of original thought based solely and purely on facts that are supported by the scholarly community. The evolution of the races, an analysis of racial origins and habitats, correlated with the development of different psyches marks this book as a first of its kind that proves a theory that just makes sense. Although race-relations is very complicated, Pearl Jr.s writing style is conversational and easy-to-read. The Climate: A Perspective Unvisited examines the complexities of the world according to race. Pearl Jr. chronologically details the stimulus that has created the worlds varied racial populations, differences in skin, eye and hair color(texture), as well as gives the reason for the distinguishable eye shape of people from (mainly) Southeast Asia. At a recent lecture, Pearl Jr. asked, ""Am I the only person who wanted to know these answers?"" The audience stood attentively silent waiting to hear more. This manual is intended to create a new movement that states, ""The final phase of equality is within our mind."" The era of slavery and the days of Jim Crow are legally abolished but what about mindsets that continue a belief system of inferiority and superiority based on race? ""Were all human beings and there shouldve never been racism. . . racism will go down in history as one of the most disastrous mistakes of mankind"" comments, speaker/author/activist, Pearl Jr.. ""The story of race is so repugnant that only a truly mature person can handle the truth""--therefore, Pearl Jr. was extremely conscientious about attitudes and wrote this manual with a solidly loving, sympathetic and many times, empathetic tone. She also states, ""the descendants of the oppressor need not feel responsible because the atrocities that racism created are not the fault of anyone living today."" The Climate: A Perspective Unvisited has already sparked much discussion and Pearl Jr. is well on her way to becoming an important leader and voice of reason in the struggle to abolish racism in every form. This is a book for all races; its main theme is education through explanation, because according to Pearl Jr, ""We all need to know the truth!"" Since its first quarter 2002 release, The Climate: A Perspective Unvisited is already in its second printing.

It is dangeroulsly honest but entirely fair and conscientous.This review of race relations and the complexities of race relations of the world really does give the reader a different way of looking at race and the origins and development of mankind.The viewpoint of African-Americanism is poignant and exposing, but gives the outlook of a better and brighter future that proves that mental equalities pertaining to race is very possible and near.I feel this book should be required reading for any social studies, anthropolgy and African-American studies class; as a matter of fact, it would be great for Latino Studies as well.This is needed!! I will now be aware of the way that I judge people internally and never judge another unless I have walked in their shoes.I feel like I have kept my personal judgments too private and sometimes unfair but now I will know how to overcome the prejudices--to which we are all guilty."

One or two mysteries carry through the book, with a couple more short ones in the midst, balanced with a healthy serving of Mma Ramotswe's wisdom and her reflections on the greatness of Botswana. Always relaxing and mildly suspenseful.This one has a subtle difference: there are no actual mysteries. The agency takes on two cases: one involves tracking down some old acquaintances, and the solution to the other is apparent to the reader within a few lines of the client walking through the door.What does that leave us with? Mma Ramotswe has competition in the form of a rude man who sets up a rival detective agency (Trust your problems to a _man_!, says the ad). The foster children experience growing pains. Mma Makutsi seeks a way to earn some extra cash. Mma Ramotse dispenses wisdom and reflects on Botswana.This is still a very pleasant read, Mma Ramotswe has some good insights to share, and the developments in the characters' personal lives are interesting. If you are lucky enough to have access to the audiobook, Lisette Lecat's narration is excellent and soothing as always. I'm glad I read it, but don't come looking for mystery."
Cartographia: Mapping Civilizations,"CARTOGRAPHIA offers a stunning array of 200 of the most beautiful, important, and fascinating maps in existence, from the world's largest cartographic collection, at the Library of Congress.

There the only comfort is found in the welcoming smiles and hospitality of strangers, as Michael learns his mother's brother's family are staunch &quot;Bible-believing&quot; folk who choose to live as &quot;plain&quot; people. Socializing among the Amish of that region, Michael's extended family's existence is founded upon a lack of material wants and needs and an abundance of faith.Gradually Michael and his family come to relax and enjoy the company of their relatives. Creature comforts fade into memory, for playing a game of baseball and tucking into homemade ice cream on the front porch appears to yield more enjoyment than a night in front of the television. However, Michael senses something amiss, particularly every time his uncle brings up issues of faith and challenges the boy to validate his own beliefs. As if dealing with the death of his father was not enough to bear, Michael soon realizes his uncle's ulterior motive for bringing his family to Kentucky -- to persuade Michael's mother of the error she made in converting to Catholicism by first converting her children to his beliefs. Michael, a lukewarm student of his own Catholic faith, is suddenly shocked to hear people dismiss the Catholic Church as &quot;pagan&quot; and &quot;unChristian.&quot;Explanations outside of actual Bible quotes (KJV version, mind you) fall upon deaf ears, and Michael is self-propelled into a crash course in apologetics, with only the Bible and the prayers of his mother to sustain him. As Michael prepares to successfully defend the Faith against the local nay-sayers, many of whom know much of the Bible by heart, his confidence grows, and it is his knowledge of the faith through God's Word which helps establish an atmosphere of tolerance which some in this tight-knit community are more willing to embrace than others.Like the works of Bud MacFarlane, Jr., Kennedy's &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; is a teaching novel, an apologetics tool in the guise of an engaging coming-of-age story. Kennedy's eye for detail is evident in his descriptions of Amish country and portrayals of life among the &quot;plain&quot; people, and Michael's dialogue and evangelization is well woven into Kennedy's prose. Kennedy delivers the facts of the faith without making it sound as if the &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; is regurgitating lines from a textbook; the reader should not feel as if he/she is being lectured, and considering the tense climactic scene where Michael faces his challengers as a witness standing trial, Kennedy should be commended for a plausible conclusion to the story. With &quot;Philadelphia Catholic&quot; Kennedy leaves us to decide the validity of the Catholic faith, and through Michael O'Shea he offers convincing arguments bracketed by a touching story."

George Eliot writes with such keen insight into such diverse lives, it staggers the imagination. Virginia Woolfe wrote that Eliot was one of the few nineteenth century authors who wrote for grown up people, and I couldn't agree more. She never insults her readers by telling them what their opinion should be of any of her characters. They are all intricately drawn with an even hand, good traits and bad. Just when you think you've found a character that it is impossible to sympathize with, Eliot debunks your opinion in a single poignant paragraph.I read and loved this book in college, and I've read it every two or three years since. It never wears thin. Anyone who wants to know how perfectly seamless a novel can be must read this masterpiece."

I like my complex Iain Banks, voluminous Alastair Reynolds, mind-bending Greg Egan and ever-changing Brunner. Now while many of the so-called `old timers' have proclaimed Foundation sacred like the novels of Dune, I am of the new generation and of the new voice, which can't be held to the same standard as the last generation (or two). Times changes, ideals change, perspectives change, terminology changes, tolerable prefixes change and personal development changes. While Dune may have been impressive in style and scope, it did not satisfy me in content, interest and follow through. To these effects, I wish to express my dissatisfaction with Foundation.To paraphrase an excellent book about the relationship between psychology and musical composition entitled `Of Mind and Music,' the author states that repetition is an exploit of human emotion causing the listener (or in this case, the reader) to fall into a collective primal rhythm with fellow listeners (read: readers). Like in Foundation, the amount of repetition is akin to the acute attack of bass at a rave; theories are repeated endlessly, idiosyncratic allegories are scattered through every chapter and the word `atomic' was shotgun blasted, litter strewn, scattered to the winds, chucked without consciousness onto nearly ever page (sign of the times, I presume?). Here is the alphabetical list of `atomic' phrases found in Foundation:Atomic blaster, atomic drill, atomic drive (also the hyperatomic drive), atomic fire, atomic force, atomic force-shield, atomic gadgets, atomic generator, atomic knife, atomic power, atomic shear, atomic ships, atomic specialists, atomic techniques, atomic washing machine (bwah!) and atomic weapons.If `style' could mean the expressed use of repetition, the Asimov has easily seduced the science fiction reader of the early 1950s. With the blossoming (pessimists read: destructive radiation) of the atomic age, the dream of an atomic future must surely have seemed to be an optimistic fantasy. Nowadays, the equivalent would be novels which saturate their content with micro- and nano- prefixes. Thus, it seems as Asimov had the initial bug of beginning of the `atomic' prefix fixation? Did Asimov overdo it? In these regards, I stand to say that Asimov had a single-tracked mind.While reading the sciences and unfolding plot of the pseudo-science, I was constantly remained of the `Seldon crisis' and the mightier-than-thou proverb `Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' As an educated reader, I only need to be reminded once to have the full effect of conveyance and depth. Throw in the tame pre-sensor curses of `Oh, space!' and the cringe-worthy `Great galloping galaxies!' and you have for yourself a novel which is mildly aggravating, almost maddening. Repetition doesn't mean a solid follow through. Rather, it just means the author is either under-evaluating the reader of filling up word space.Additionally, the characters were as bland as cardboard for breakfast. Everyone seemed to be a utopian plutocrat or an idealistic capitalist in a struggling capitalist society. Scientists know best, so scientists so rule, right? It's ONE vision of style of government but the path Asimov takes is one of superiority and, ultimately, disagreement. The approach is too preachy to the benefits of an ideal technocratic civilization. Throughout, I understood the relationships and the dealings between opposing parties, but I found the unraveling as tedious as the usage of the word `atomic.' Politico scenes compounded by feudal titles bored me to bits, much like Herbert's Dune, Tepper's Grass and some of Wolfe's Long Sun series. While the over-all feudal scene works well with the future technocratic/religious society, I find the kowtowing to be overwhelming (more so considering I already live in a fairly visible feudal society).Inevitably, as the word and review suggest, I must say that the novel has failed to impress me in the year 2010 after 30 years of mortality and four years of reading science fiction. Surely, many modern novels must have been based off the ideals presented in Foundation, but from my standpoint in the ear 2010, I fail to see greatness which was intrinsically embossed upon it during its publication and further years of intense readership. In the year 2010, the novel does not stand the ultimate test of time."

Things were going smoothly until the periodic prediction (when Seldon appears holographically) was obviously wrong.The cause is the Mule, a mutant of incredible mental powers who no one has ever seen. The introduction of this character was one of the best plot devices used in a long time and it gave the fledging story a much-needed boost. Who is this mutant and why does he do the things he does?

Closer Than a Brother,"Modern Christianity is adrift. In numerous congregations, complacency and indifference have become the norm rather than the exception. What is the missing ingredient? A large part of the problem is that we have yet to truly tap into the power of the one another way. Closer Than a Brother provides a practical, modern take on the one another scriptures and the Biblical imperative to disciple. With a writing style that is both compelling and provocative, F. Barton Davis analyzes both the scriptures and common pitfalls that have beset fellowships that have wrestled with these issues, providing unique insight and valuable direction, making Closer Than a Brother a tremendous aid for both personal spiritual enrichment, and as a practical tool for teaching and group work. ""Unlocking the secrets of the one another way"" is vital to our personal spiritual health and to the growth of the Lord's church. Closer Than a Brother shines a light that cuts through the uncertainty, grabs hold of the scriptures and unveils the secrets of this glorious path. It is time to unlock the power!",['F.

It sounds a little cheesy as an translation, but if you want a book discussion and your bookclub or small groups are not readers who would wade through the language of Brother Lawrence's French translations, this gets the gist of the themes in a much easier reading level. Not everyone who thinks deeply, needs to read graduate level material to discuss life questions. I had long since lost the book, but remembered it for years and was delighted to find it again online and order a copy. I would recommend it and caution readers not to be put off by the ""hospital kitchen adaptation"", it still maintains much of his train of thought on hard questions in a light way. Especially good for high school and unchurched groups."

This book is literally a diary he kept during the last year of his life. Best known as the subject of &quot;Bob Flanagan: Supermasochist&quot;, there isn't much kink or S/M in this. This is a man dealing with mortality, reviewing his past life, trying to accomplish all he has set out for himself before he is gone. At that same time that this journal was being written, a documentary was being made, which would eventually be called &quot;Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan&quot; and it won the Sundance Special Grand Prize in 1997. This journal is an excellent companion to the film, and a final view of the man in his own words."

This guide is actually the best, having very good in-depth descriptions for each card. The second best book is &quot;Playing Card Divination For Beginers&quot; by Richard Webster, which has a slightly different aproach to reading the cards, but not the detailed descriptions as Dee Nerys book.

Conquistador,"Conquistador Voices, a two-volume work by Kevin H. Siepel, is intended for the general reader. The book presents the history of the Spanish Conquest of the Americas principally through the voices of those who participated in that signal event. Its goal is to make this story engaging by substantial use of first-person narrative--much of it newly translated from Spanish and Italian sources.The overall story is told in five parts, each part featuring a principal Conquest actor--an explorer or conquistador. Volume I is devoted to the four voyages of Christopher Columbus, and to the subsequent conquest of Mexico by Hernan Cortes.Volume I opens with a scene-setting narrative and introduction to Columbus, a man with an unshakable belief in an idea and a dogged determination to carry out that idea. Columbus's landing and initial encounter with the peoples of the Americas is covered, as is his worsening relationship with the colonists, his arrest and removal to Spain, his rehabilitation, and his subsequent year-long, mutiny-ridden isolation on a Jamaican beach. Equally well covered are the many aspects of his complex personality.The second part of volume I covers the conquest of Mexico and the Aztecs by Hernan Cortes. We are taken on the early exploratory voyages to the Mexican coast, eventually to land there with Cortes and his not-totally-loyal troops. We see Cortes take charge of his men, gather initially-hostile Indian warriors to his cause, and move this large force inexorably toward the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. We witness Cortes's bold seizure of the Aztec king Montezuma, the Spaniards' flight from the capital on the noche triste, Cortes's determination to hold this land against attacking Spaniards, and his final razing of the city with the slaughter of most of its inhabitants.An effort has been made throughout Conquistador Voices to avoid moralizing on these events, but to report them--with all due filtering of wheat from chaff--as we have been told that they occurred. Nine maps accompany the text, along with index, copious footnotes, and brief bibliography.",['Kevin H.

Thus he is able to cause the reader to engage in a subconcious seesaw of values.He begins this contrasting early in the book. Who are the bad guys?

"Ghosts of Vesuvius: A New Look at the Last Days of Pompeii, How Towers Fall, and Other Strange Connections","A fascinating look at Pompeii, Herculaneum and the Vesuvius eruption in comparison with other historically significant volcanic eruptions, including the World Trade Center disaster. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, which obliterated the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, was a disaster that resounds to this day. Now palaeontologist Charles Pellegrino presents a wealth of new knowledge about the doomed towns – and brings to vivid life the people, their last moments, and the aftermath. The lessons learned from modern scrutiny of that ancient eruption produce disturbing echoes in the present. Dr Pellegrino, who worked at Ground Zero in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack, shares his unique knowledge of the strange physics of volcanic 'downblast' and 'collapse column', drawing a direct link from past to present, and providing readers with a poignant glimpse into the last moments of the 'American Vesuvius'.",['Charles R.

For example - the author waxes poeticlly about the fall of Byzantium. However he puts the date at 535 AD. Actually around 535 AD was close to the height of the Byzantium's power. By 552 they had conqured Italy. The empire fell but not unil 1453 almost a thousand years after Charles has it ending.And when he isn't making silly errors of fact (5 minutes on the internet would have fixed my example) he is fond of making bald statements about natural history that are at best, aguable, and at worst just plain wrong. For example he talks about the decline of the dinosaurs prior to the comet impact, even citing Gould on the subject. What he didn't do was read Gould's later writings and other studies that concluded that dinosaurs were not in decline prior to the impact, they were cut down in mid stride. While like all points this is debateable, Charles showed a curious disinterest in current thinking on this subject.And even when he cites Gould he makes silly mistakes - He writes ""Gould toward the end of his life wrote:"" and then quotes a passage from Gould's book Wonderful Life. Now wonderful life was written in 1989. Gould died in 2002 - 13 years after he wrote that book. I can't by any stretch call 1989 toward the end of his life 1999 yes, 1989 no.And it goes on. He talks of the rise of intellect and tool using civilizations as being sometihng invetable - something Gould would have disagreed with.He does write well and and he does have sense of the loss and the human scale of the disaster it's just he can't keep his damn facts straight."

Soul-searching (literally) provocative discussions on the nature and the very definition of death, immortality, spirituality, morality, love, compassion, hatred, infidelity and more are what elevates Sawyer's novel from the realm of a mere hard sci-fi murder mystery into the class of a Nebula Award winner! He even goes so far as to touch upon the existence of a soul and its effect upon religious beliefs and global events.Dr Peter Hobson, a successful businessman and bio-technology engineer, has created an EEG orders of magnitude more sensitive than all of the machines currently available. When he uses his scanner to detect an electrical field leaving the body after death, which he calls the ""soul wave"", he then collaborates with his best friend, an AI specialist, to create three computer simulations of his own brain - one modified to represent the spirit, or life after death; a second, modified to have no concept of death or aging, representing immortality; and the third left untouched as a scientific control. The self-determining simulations escape from the confines of the AI lab's computers into the world wide net and the murders begin. One of them is a murderer but the question, of course, is which one, why and how to stop it?Sawyer's clever literary device of using snippets from newscasts and magazine or newspaper articles is not only entertaining but it places the issues he has chosen to address in his novel into a global context and hypothesizes on the effects that these types of discoveries would have on a worldwide scale ... at once thought provoking, amusing, sobering and educational!On a complete aside, I was also grateful to Sawyer for using his story as an example of what Charles Dickens was trying to convey in his famous opening paragraph in ""The Tale of Two Cities"" - you know the one, ""It was the best of times. It was the worst of times ..."". Until Sawyer illustrated the idea using his own story, I was always foggy about this ambiguous juxtaposition of complete opposites. But Sawyer switched on the light bulb for me.Highly recommended!Paul Weiss"
Blood Canticle,"Anne Rice continues her astonishing Vampire Chronicles in a new novel that begins where Blackwood Farm left off — and tells the story of Lestat’s quest for redemption, goodness, and the love of Rowan Mayfair. Welcome back to Blackwood Farm. Here are all of the brilliantly conceived characters that make up the two worlds of vampires and witches: Mona Mayfair, who’s come to the farm to die and is brought into the realm of the undead; her uncle, Julian Mayfair, guardian of the family, determined to forever torment Lestat for what he has done to Mona; Rowan Mayfair, brilliant neurosurgeon and witch, who finds herself dangerously drawn to the all-powerful Lestat; her husband, Michael Curry, hero of the Mayfair Chronicles, who seeks Lestat’s help with the temporary madness of his wife; Ash Templeton, a 5,000-year-old Taltos who has taken Mona’s child; and Patsy, the country-western singer, who returns to avenge her death at the hands of her son, Quinn Blackwood. Delightfully, at the book’s centre is the Vampire Lestat, once the epitome of evil, now pursuing the transformation set in motion with Memnoch the Devil. He struggles with his vampirism and yearns for goodness, purity and love, as he saves Patsy’s ghost from the dark realm of the Earthbound, uncovers the mystery of the Taltos and unselfishly decides the fate of his beloved Rowan Mayfair.

The Afghan happens to come in dead last in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs book. The training methods are also outdated when more positive methods are successfully used. I don't like it at all when she suggests shaking a dog. In her book she doesn't have all breeds, and based on some gross inaccuracies, I don't trust it.

However, this is not the James Bond of the many novels most recently written by Raymond Benson. He is more of a reserved gentleman albeit a ladies man, however, nowhere near the extent he is on the big screen. He also takes a heck of a pounding by the bad guys who are not quite so over the top. He is a bit less of a superman.In this installment Bond is ordered to travel to Japan to help provide security for the many world leaders at the G8 summit conference. However, he is also asked to look into the deaths of a prominent family all of whom died quite suddenly of a mysterious ailment. As Bond investigates with his friend, Tiger Tanaka, they discover a plot with a unique but potent weapon that could place many lives at risk at the G8 summit.One-dimensional characters and a plot that for much of the book plods along, make this a less than stellar entry into the Bond series. Any sense of originality that the books possessed has worn thin for many years. Yet, Bond remains a very popular hero and, with the continued success of the motion pictures, we can expect the books to keep on coming no matter who writes them."

Rushton,3/4,5.0,1096416000,Take time to stop and smell the roses,"This is a children's book?Perhaps. Maybe, as Saint Exupery implies, adults are too sophisticated, too wise, too adult, to understand the eloquent common sense about living a rational life. It takes some thought, insight and reason to comprehend the innate meaning. It's the ultimate 'take time to stop and smell the roses"" book, which brings to mind an anecdote from 'Art and Fear' by David Batles and Ted Orland, quoting Howard Ikemoto:""When my daughter was about seven years old, she asked me one day what I did at work. I told her I worked at the college -- that my job was to teach people how to draw.""She stared back at me, incredulous, and said, 'You mean they forget?'""The Little Prince is just as incredulous about many attitudes he encounters on Earth; on his travels, he keeps meeting adults who are wrapped up in their self-importance and egos. Surely, Saint Exupery understood the difference; his dedication was to ""Leon Werth"" in 1943 France, which he ""corrected"" to read, ""To Leon Werth when he was a little boy.""It's a book of wonderful important things which children understand (it made me appreciate once again the importance of rotten crab apples) but which we set aside as adults. Children will understand it instinctively in their hearts . . . . . think of reading a few pages every night as a child falls asleep. Adults will love the allegories, and it will truly bring back memories of their own rag doll, or blankie (to use a term from Peanuts), or worn baseball glove, or even their own squishy soft rotten apples.As adults, we are all familiar with advertising; but, how manjy of us realize that advertising is lies -- not in an absolute literal sense -- but because it emphasizes terrible destructive myths and untruths to us (Do things really go better with Coke?)Written in 1943, when Adolf Hitler dominated much of Europe, the Little Prince meets an ""absolute monarch"" who tells him, ""Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution."" In other words, absolute authority depends on being reasonable; unreasonable orders reflect a failure of the person giving the order, not a fault of anyone unable to carry out such an order.""When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a litte from the truth,"" Saint Exupery writes. Balance that with an observation by Pablo Picasso, ""Computers are useless -- all they can give you are answers.""In a world jammed with billions of facts and little or no understanding, this book is a reminder that a full and complete life is more than ""the bottom line"" of anything. Had I read it as a little boy, I don't think I'd have understood its wisdom; had I read it as an young adult, I don't think I'd have understood its wisdom; having at last read it, I hope I'm not to late to understand its wisdom."

Peace Like a River,,,,,,,,,,1417616903,,A3NC6OGGAZXVDS,Cville Dad,11/11,4.0,1042588800,A unique new voice tells an original tale,"Part family saga, part fable, this was the story of the Land family's cross-country odyssey. Father Jeremiah, 11-year old asthmatic Rueben and his younger, child-prodigy sister Swede set out across the harsh winter landscape of the American west to find Davy, the eldest brother, who is on the lamb after breaking out of jail for shooting and killing two local reprobates when they break into the Land home.Enger has a beautiful and unique way of telling this story, even if the story itself is rather implausible in some ways. But remember, it IS fiction, so he can make Jeremiah Land a miracle worker if he wants. Swede, too, is a bit on the unbelievable side with her stunning vocabulary, impeccable memory and rapacious interest in the Wild West. I did find Rueben to be a very convincing character, and Davy too, although we never really get to know too much about Davy (what with him being a fugitive).Jeremiah may seem too much of a Christ-like figure to be believed, too, but he was a strong character nonetheless, and I wanted to believe that he was capable of performing miracles, as we all would probably like to believe that miracles can indeed happen during the course of our mundane lives.There was only fleeting mention made of the children's mother, and I thought this was somewhat problematic-Rueben never really mentions her nor do the children seem to make an issue out of not having a mother. However, when Roxanna (a mother figure herself), comes into their lives, they do accept her willingly and eagerly.Overall, I found this to be an inspiring, spiritual tale that made me wish miracles were more prevalent in this ordinary world or that I knew someone like Jeremiah land who could make them happen."
Song of Kali,"The World Fantasy Award winner by the author of the Hyperion Cantos and Carrion Comfort: An American finds himself encircled by horrors in Calcutta.

Agnes Grey,"Anne Bronte, was born on 17th Jan, 1820 at Thornton, Yorkshire, England, and died on 28th May, 1849 at Scarborough, Yorkshire. She was an English poet and novelist. Her sisters Charlotte and Emily Bronte both were poets & novelist. Anne Brontes pen name was Acton Bell. She was the youngest member of the Bronte literary family. She wrote two novels-Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. Anne along with her sisters wrote poems and published as Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Anne attended one boarding school just for a year. At home, Annes studies included music and drawing. Although her aunt tried to make Anne and her sister to be perfect in household, but they all were interested in literature only. Annes father was having a good collection of books of various renowned authors and subjects related books as well. Anne used to read mostly, Bible, Homer, Shakespeare, Milton and others. She took interest in history, geography and biographical books. This way, her imagination and creativity blend grew high. Even she developed one imaginary world. Her literary talent grew up. Anne had worked as governess for almost 6 years. Her second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, was considered as one of the first feminist novels. Anne was deeply affected by the death of her sister Emily Bronte at the age of just 29. It lead to her deteriorating physical health. Anne was a brave lady. She wasnt scared of death, as she too felt ill. She requested God, to allow her a little more in this world just to do some good before leaving this world. Whatever she wrote in poems and novels became classics in the literary world.",['Anne Bronte'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pds7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Pds7EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Agnes+Grey&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Diamond Pocket Books Pvt Ltd,2021-08-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pds7EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],1.0,0786108568,39.95,AFYYHRPSFBLWS,Ash Ryan,1/1,4.0,1331251200,"Yeesh, how does she put up with those brats?!","As a novel that follows the plight of a young woman forced into the position of a governess to make ends meet, Anne Bronte's Agnes Grey has of course often been compared with her sister's more famous novel Jane Eyre. And as a love story, it has also been compared with the novels of Jane Austen. It even reminded me a little of the cautionary morality tales that had been popular up to that time, such as Defoe's Moll Flanders.Personally, I enjoyed it more than Pride and Prejudice, but not as much as Jane Eyre. It just doesn't have the same scope and depth. Anne's second novel, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, on the other hand, does, so I would recommend that over this. That said, this is a nice little novel, and interesting, and sometimes very funny. Well worth reading.And this audio edition narrated by Emilia Fox, who does an excellent job, is very enjoyable to listen to."
Mother night (Bard books),,,,,,,,,,B0007DLN60,,A19G8FGK1S1062,"""lilstarofdavid""",51/52,5.0,980294400,A hilariously addictive and heart-breakingly poignant book,"""My name is Howard W. Campbell, Jr. I am an American by birth, a Nazi by reputation, and a nationless person by inclination"" are the opening words to Kurt Vonnegut's tale of an American playwright living in Germany who, once World War II begins, becomes a Nazi radio propagandist. He becomes infamous for his disgustingly brutal radio shows which distributed wicked Nazi propaganda. He was thoroughly hated by the Americans, and loved by the Nazis. But there is one thing that you should know about Howard W. Campbell. He is an American spy. His radio shows are the medium for transmitting secret codes out of Germany to aid the American cause in the war. He was one of the most effective spies of World War II, and one of the only ones to survive the war. But after the war, he is simply discarded in a small New York attic apartment, with enough money to live the rest of his days there, but with no more direction to his life. He lives his life simply there, away from civilization and anyone who might recognize him as a war criminal, until a white supremacist discovers where he is located, and he once again must face his past. Mother Night is not a traditional war book, for rather than concentrating on the brutal aspects of combat, it focuses heavily on the equally gruesome subject of hate. Vonnegut also dissects the schizophrenic mind of a spy after the war has ended who has not only lost the trust of everyone he loves, but most importantly, his identity altogether, as he realizes he is a ""nationless"" person. The narrator is constantly questioning his identity, which has been muddled by his spy experiences. Vonnegut also discusses the minds of the Nazis, how ordinary and often intelligent men and women could be prompted to become the vicious killing machines that they were during World War IIMother Night is a sharp, funny book thats humor is both satiric and farcical. It is a very entertaining read with twists and turns at every corner, including a surprise ending that is sure to catch the reader off-guard. Although Kurt Vonnegut is more well-known for his novels such as Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle, Mother Night is truly an overlooked classic that offers an entertaining read for not just fans of war books, but any reader looking for a hilariously addictive and heart-breakingly poignant book."

Hunger Point : A Novel,"“[An] unusually honest, painfully funny novel about a tight-knit family’s struggle.” —Entertainment Weekly ""My parents may love me, but I also know they view me as a houseguest who is turning a weekend stay into an all-expense-paid, lifelong residency, and who (to their horror) constantly forgets to flush the toilet and shut off the lights."" Twenty-six-year-old Frannie Hunter has just moved back home. Bright, wry, blunt, and irreverent, she invites you to witness her family's unraveling. Her Harvard-bound sister is anorexic, her mother is having an affair, her father is obsessed with the Food Network, and her grandfather wants to plan her wedding (even though she has no fiancé, let alone a steady boyfriend). By turns wickedly funny and heartbreakingly bittersweet, Hunger Point chronicles Frannie's triumph over her own self-destructive tendencies, and offers a powerful exploration of the complex relationships that bind together a contemporary American family. You will never forget Frannie, a ""sultry, suburban Holden Caulfield,"" whom critics have called ""the most fully realized character to come along in years,"" (Paper) nor will you forget Hunger Point, an utterly original novel that stuns with its amazing insights and dazzles with its fresh, distinctive voice.",['Jillian Medoff'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kUhcqtBR8XkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kUhcqtBR8XkC&pg=PP4&dq=Hunger+Point+:+A+Novel&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-10-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kUhcqtBR8XkC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],6.0,B000CC49MQ,6.0,,,0/1,4.0,859766400,Not bad.,"&quot;Hunger Point&quot; isn't bad for a first novel.

Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero,,,,,,,,,,B00024YANW,,A2G2GJJXB4R8BE,Mark Daniels,7/9,4.0,1085097600,"Great biography, depressing ending","This is a fascinating and illuminating book about a talented baseball player, a military hero, and a cantankerous curmudgeon - Ted Williams. Montville does a terrific job of encapsulating the Splendid Splinter's eventful 83 years into a fascinating 500-page book, complete with nearly a hundred black-and-white photographs, many never before seen. If you're looking for a biography of Ted Williams this is probably the one to get; it covers his entire life, something that his 1969 autobiography doesn't do (obviously).Montville doesn't shine much new light onto the Public Ted - any true baseball fan is already familiar with his battles with the media, his 406 average in 1941, his weak performance in the 1946 World Series, the two military interruptions to his baseball career, his storybook home run in his final at-bat, etc. We already knew that stuff. Where the book truly shines is in illuminating the Private Ted...The selfish Ted, who'd drag uninterested wives along with him on fishing trips, and who'd rather be alone in a boat somewhere than be present for his children's births; his lustful enjoyment of his hobbies was more important than his family. The angry and blasphemous Ted, who'd spit at fans and frequently (and colorfully) take the Lord's name in vain with a smattering of the f-word and his favorite modifier, &quot;syphilitic.&quot; The lonely Ted, who married three beautiful trophy wives, had teammates and friends all over the country, yet still lacked the unconditional love he desperately needed. Somehow Montville manages to paint Williams as sympathetic, lovable, and even heroic, while still telling the story of a bitter and cranky man.Thankfully, there were at least a few caring people in Ted's life to help diffuse his negativity and give him unconditional love: Louise Kaufman, the grandmotherly woman who became Ted's longtime companion after his three failed marriages to younger women, and the male nurses who took care of him during his final decade on Earth.Sadly, the book (like Williams's life) ends on an unavoidable down-note. Montville frightens us with the awful tale of Ted's money-grubbing son, John-Henry. Here the author fairly throws objectivity aside, painting the younger Williams in tones reminiscent of Shakespeare's Iago. John-Henry's underhanded machinations and obvious treatment of Ted as a meal ticket rather than a beloved father left me feeling sad and depressed at the story's end. Junior was more concerned with his progenitor's ability to sign and sell valuable autographs than his comfort and welfare during his declining years. The demon seed of Ted Williams kept his father's friends and loved ones from calling and visiting, and then - in an act which violated Ted's wish for cremation, as per his will - John-Henry had his father cryogenically frozen after his death. Thus began the fighting and infinite court proceedings between Ted's offspring - an embarrassing and surreal coda to a life otherwise lived with integrity and dignity.A great book about a great man. As sports biographies go, it's surely one of the best - just like Ted.(News update: John-Henry Williams, 35, died of leukemia in March 2004. Perhaps now the legal maneuvering will stop; perhaps Ted can at last be cremated and have his ashes spread across the waters of Florida, just as he wanted. Meanwhile, thanks to John-Henry, the decapitated head of Ted Williams remains in a frozen vat in Arizona.)"
Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero,,,,,,,,,,B000OXL2WI,,,,0/2,4.0,1090195200,A must read for Williams fans...,"This book is a must read for Williams fans, Red Sox fans and baseball fans in general. I felt this book was one of the most balanced books I have read aboout Williams. Not only does it pay tribute to his success on the field and in the air during WW II and Korea, but also decribes his many faults. I have always been a fan of Montville and this book, simply put, is a great one."

And frankly, I was not even a Ted Williams fan before I picked it up. I knew very little about him and didn't remember him, having been born in 1961. But the portrait Montville draws is remarkably detailed and nuanced. This book goes beyond the person and gives glimpses of the times."

The comparison of Napoleon and Snowball to Stalin and Trotsky is very good. But I think its too abusive of Communism. I know Communism is not very good if ot used properly, as it destroys much of people's freedom. But it is not as bad as some people make it sound. However, if it works well, as Karl Marx dreamed, then it can be good for the people who it governs. But when its true meaning becomes abused, it is then that it can be destructive and people lose freedom and other things. This does happen often in such a government, and despite his aptitude for writing, Orwell exxagerates in making the generalization that Communism always leads to chaos and loss of freedom and voice, which is not true. The reason I think that it is so good despite this is that in Orwell's time Communism was just emerging. What Orwell experienced of Communism was horrible, therefore he is under no circumstances responsible for makig this exxageration. It is just today, in 1998, that we can look back at history and really see that despite most Communist governments becoming destructive of freedom, if COmmunism is used as Karl Marx hoped, then it can be a good government.Person, Age 12"

I remember my high school english instructor saying something along these lines, ""I see no reason to have you read Animal Farm."" Of course this was the same instructor pushing Clinton/Gore bumper stickers on us for extra credit (kind of like telling kindergardners you'll give them as many Jolly Ranchers as they want if they vote clinton/gore). I was young, impressionable, and living with two far left parents (they both voted for Mondale for God sake). Years later I was actually listening to Michael Savage while in grid lock traffic. He was talking about our current political climate and discussing it in relation to Animal Farm (I had no frame of referance). I was still a far left little wacko myself and was only listening to Savage so I could argue with him (Portland Oregon has a way of doing that to impressionable youth). This was the moment I started to awake from my fog. I decided to purchase this fine book (got it used right here on Amazon for less than a dollar).If you want specifics about the story this is the wrong review for you. Instead I am going to focus on what this story did to open my eyes. I began to read this book and amazingly my entire political universe changed. Why did my high school teacher decide this book wasn't important. If anything the story is historical in that it describes the reality of the American mind during the cold war. How was this book tossed aside so easily by teachers who were supposed to be teaching me to think for myself? The clouds started to lift from my eyes. I began to realize that I had been blindly following like the rest of the sheeple. That's when I started reading, thinking, not believing statements just because so and so said so.I eventually gave this book away at a garage sale. It was hard for me to part with this tathered old library copy of Animal Farm. The old horse (Boxer was his name right?) who kept trying to work harder for the Marxist Pigs; only to be sold for slaughter once his usefulness to the Pigs had come to an end. It reminds me of the middle class who say to themselves ""I must work harder"" in our current society to maintain their current standard of living. Will we as Americans end up at the financial slaughter house because of the free trade practices of semi socialist government? Most don't realize that Marx expressed the need for free trade in letters to Engels in order to bring down the bourgeois.The pigs preached in the beginning that ""four legs good, two legs bad."" Sounds like the nonsense that disseminates like a disease from the Repugnicans and Demoncrats. They both spew their hate and promise change. Yet somehow just like the pigs they both end up walking on two legs in the end. The end of the book states that men were with the pigs (playing cards I believe). They started to fight and their countanences were the same.This book is a must read if your teacher just so happened to leave this off your high school reading list. Originally written to depict communism. How sad that you can see communism spreading into our own society now."

Led by two other boars, Napoleon and Snowball, the farm animals with the stalwart shire horse, Boxer, oust the incompetent, selfish farmer, Mr. Jones, and change Manor Farm to ""Animal Farm"", henceforth to be governed by the revered laws of Animalism, and its Seven Commandments. However, venality and brute force subvert the high ideals of Animalism, leading to its ironic culmination, which Orwell sums up in the distortion of the final, and most sacred commandment. No spoilers. Read it for yourself.History buffs will find delightful parallels in the many personifications of past Russian Revolutionary figures, whether it's Old Major as Lenin; the gifted, inventive Snowball as Trotsky; or, the brutal, cunning Napoleon as one of recent history's megalomaniacal dictators - Stalin. Then, there's the litigious, double-dealing farmer, Foxwood as the United States, and the gentleman farmer, Pilkington as England/Europe. Not to be left out is Religion - ""the opium of the masses"" - as represented by Moses, the Raven, squawking about Sugarcandy Mountain, and the rewards awaiting hardworking animals. Most moving perhaps, is Boxer. His betrayal by the pigs is ultimately the betrayal of the common man, who is the backbone of any nation.Orwell's writing style is masterly, never a word out of place. His sense of social injustice and righteous anger never boils over into melodrama, or cheap manipulation. ""Animal Farm"" is not a story with a happy ending, but history is a very long story. Unfortunately, Orwell died before the end of the Soviet Empire. But perhaps, he saw it coming anyway. No dictator stays in power forever, just long enough to do maximum damage in minimum time."

But undoubtedly this book contains so many subtleties and undertones that transcend most readers. The readers who get them, however, are brilliantly provoked. Moby Dick is the story of a vengeful captain Ahab embroiled in the fight of his life, the fight for the intangibly malignant great white whale. Herman Melville's messages on ambiguity, power, and masks are incredible. For example, his use of deconstruction and contradiction in describing man's discovery that there are things out there that are better left unknown, like with Moby Dick, are universally applicable. Moby Dick is not for everyone; it is a long book that can get monotonous and rambling. But just when people start to get agitated with its pace, Melville throws in some brilliant lines and ideas that are so powerful they can be hard to pick up. I encourage everyone, however, to give this book a shot. If you are really interested in reading the greatest novel of the 19th century, give yourself at least a month to do so. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. In time, you might start to agree what a remarkable book this is."

This one is.","A few years back I made a conscious decision to read (and in some cases re-read) a number of books that fall into the category of ""classics."" The books that stand the test of time the best have an uncanny ability to feel modern and relevant no matter how long ago they were written. It's almost as if there is a certain current that runs down through the years that flows with a permanence that most don't. If a writer can tap into this current, their writing can be timeless; a classic.Herman Melville tapped into that current in spades in this story. Despite this book being over 150 years old, the themes Melville selected from many obviously available to him are themes that are just as relevant an engaging today as they were in 1851. Further, Melville somehow had a handle on using language that would not seem outdated even after a century and a half.What you get is a great story about a revenge-obsessed man, characters to whom you can easily relate and colorful descriptions of the life of a whaleman. It all comes together beautifully.Any drawbacks? Sure, Melville's story slows in the middle of the book as he goes into a deep examination of the physical characteristics of various whales, but it's still interesting and it's just not enough to take away from the rest of this novel.Highly recommended."

I sat and cracked open the book and by the third chapter I realized I would be needing a dictionary handy. I never got farther than that in my first attempt and this second attempt was only made successful for not having to stop to look up the hundreds of archaic words. There were still quite a few that my integrated dictionary couldn't fin, but taking the time to look these up was far less damaging to the reading experience than had I gone with the print version. A word of caution: the free version of the ebook I read (ASIN:B004TRXX7C) had errors whenever it dealt with lists of numbers i.e. list of money valuations, weights, etc. Frequently the text was egregiously wrong with the first number in the list.Using the Moby Dick Big Read Along website was also crucial to my finishing this novel.

The site is dedicated to a free podcast reading of the novel with each chapter being read by someone different. There were only a few chapters I could not listen to (because of their style of reading) but on the whole, reading the ebook along with this verbal reading made the experience magnitudes better. There are times in the novel when it was not clear to me that a dialog was taking place, but the vocal performances made it explicitly clear. Also, Melville abuses commas and semicolons like a champ and the vocal readings made it much easier to find the flow of sentence than deciphering it out on my own. Added bonus is that there are a few celebrity readers such as Tilda Swinton and Benedict Cumberbatch.My experienceThis is a hard read but a rewarding one. Yet, I would caution the reader that if you're looking for a thriller - fast paced and exciting - this is not the book for it. There is action but it is far outweighed by the academics of whaling. On the whole, my experience with this book is to, at a very high level, say it is the grandfather of tales such as the movie Jaws. There's a fellow that knows all the biology of the animal (Hooper/Ishmael), a fellow that wants to keep everyone safe and kill the beast but not at the expense of his own life (Brody/Starbuck) and the fellow that will stop at nothing to see this beast dead by his own hands (Quint/Ahab).However, most of the book is dedicated not to the backbone of the Jaws storyline but rather to the documentation of whaling. Much like the book 20,000 Leagues Under The Seas, there are entire chapters (several actually) that take painstaking care in documenting the biology and happenings of the time - the anatomy of a whale, the various species of whale, the history of whale depictions, the process of hunting for whale, the process of dismantling a whale, the worth of whale parts (oil, ambergris, bone, etc) and exacting detail of the components of a whaling ship. It feels more like a biology lesson rather than a novel and in this day in age, it really made me wonder why anyone would go through so much trouble to hunt a whale. However as tedious as these parts can be, I found it incredibly interesting... almost as if it were a tome to a dying art. These sailors were the Deadliest Catch fishermen of their day and age. They suffered weather, rations, tediousness, physical hardship, sharks, and seclusion in hopes of bringing home enough oil to sell and receive their share. Many did not come home (or like Ahab didn't come home whole) and that was just part of expectations of such a hazardous profession.But if you can slog through those parts, the pay off is incredible. All that I knew about this novel (and that most people will hear about this novel) only takes place in the last three chapters of this 135 chapter novel. But the characters are so rich and interesting. The harpooners, Queequeg, Tashtego and Daggoo are my favorite characters because they are so different from anyone else. Ishmael, our narrator, is an interesting fellow himself. He seems to have a bit of jading toward religion (""I'll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy."" p. 46) but in all other things seems to be a fair narrator by conveying more of what he sees rather than commentary about what he sees. And of course there is steady Starbuck and our mad Captain Ahab. Ahab is more of a brooding figure that does not prominently play into the action until well into the second half of the novel. Ahab has a singular determination for revenge. Above the profit of the ship, the lives of his crew and even above his own life itself, Ahab's singular purpose for this voyage is to find and kill Moby Dick. He is so tortured by his first encounter with the White Whale, that revenge consumes him to the point that he no longer wishes to live if it means he must endure Moby Dick living as well. It is an all consuming hatred that drives Ahab and that in the end costs him everything. It is proof positive that frequently, hatred consumes the person rather than the object of the hate.Similar to Ahab, Moby Dick himself doesn't make an appearance in the novel until the antepenultimate chapter. Much like the movie Jaws, you'll have to wait quite some time to actually see the monster in all his glory. In Ahab's obsession over Moby Dick, I found it intriguing that Ahab truly believed that Moby Dick can hold a grudge and have a single mind for attacking rather than fleeing a capture. Whales apparently normally don't attack with viciousness, yet this is exactly what happens upon meeting the unique creature.The short of it - if you want to take a shortcut, read just the last three chapters and that will get you about 90% of everything you've ever heard about this book. If you want the full experience, I would strongly suggest taking your time reading it and augmenting a print version with an audio version. It helps immensely.Popular CultureThe thing I love most about reading classics is it becomes clear that all works of art are somehow connected or based on others. Slogging through and enduring the bulk of the archaic and There were several instances of this in Moby Dick.On two occasions, the movie Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan echoed lines from Moby Dick. The first was when addressing his first mate Starbuck and the listening crew, Ahab confirms that it was indeed Moby Dick that took his leg. Displaying all his enmity for the whale, Ahab shows to what lengths he is willing to go to hunt down and kill him when he declares,""I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames before I give him up.""- CHAPTER 36 The Quarter-Deck (p. 150)The second came at the end of the book. Ahab again utters a familiar quote. Similar to Khan, in his last moments of life, Ahab says,""Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.""- CHAPTER 135 The Chase - Third Day (p.538)The last pop culture reference I found in Moby Dick was a short but lovely song that the harpooners and sailors were singing on the Pequod - and it's because I first heard it from Quint in the movie Jaws:""Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!""- CHAPTER 40 Midnight, Forecastle (p. 158)Finding these gems not only made Moby Dick more fun, but it also gave me an appreciation for the other works and characters who referenced the lines from the novel and in the case of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the depth of what they were saying by using these references.In all, I wanted the feeling of accomplishment for reading a classic that is so frequently referenced and I can say definitively that I have that. It was an amazing month long journey through a book that I fear will pass into unreadability because of it's archaic nature and we would be all the poorer for it."

"Till Death Do Us Part: Love, Marriage, and the Mind of the Killer Spouse","Every day six people in the United States are murdered by spouses or intimate partners. The stories of killer spouses tend to captivate us, as they beg the question of how so many seemingly normal and happy people manage to go over the edge. Indeed, every relationship presents ""extreme moments"" where scary feelings surface, yet what happens when those feelings turn to action? In Till Death Do Us Part, noted psychotherapist Dr. Robi Ludwig, along with journalist Matt Birkbeck, presents the psychological profiles of notorious killer spouses -- from Scott Peterson and Clara Harris to Rabbi Fred Neulander and Betty Broderick. Ludwig reveals ten killer personality types. These ten personality types are defined in detail and illustrated with examples from high-profile cases along with in-depth analyses of the motivations behind the murders. The ten types range from the Betrayal/Abandonment Killer (who loses control and kills from a broken heart) to the Control Killer (who micromanages every aspect of the spouse's life) and the Black Widow/Profit Killer (who kills for money). With gripping stories and probing insight, authors Ludwig and Birkbeck examine the concept of peaceful versus violent resolution and why certain spouses believe murder is the best and only response. In an age when spousal murder is headline news, Till Death Do Us Part explores a phenomenon that many spouses can't help but think about at some point in their relationships -- which sheds light on the very notion of ""happily ever after.""","['Robi Ludwig', 'Matt Birkbeck']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2StRZcomfF0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=2StRZcomfF0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Till+Death+Do+Us+Part:+Love,+Marriage,+and+the+Mind+of+the+Killer+Spouse&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Simon and Schuster,2006-03-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2StRZcomfF0C&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],,1400102243,22.79,A17MCLE6REW5XC,"Michelle L.

"Two years before the mast;: A personal narrative of life at sea,","This book is a fascinating and detailed chronicle of over two years spent in the American merchant service during the early 1800s. Written as a journal, it depicts the adventures and vicissitudes of a young sailor travelling from Boston around Cape Horn and on to the west coast of North America.

In its day was one of the most widely read, and important, books ever published. It recounts a young Harvard mans decision to take time off school and ""cut his teeth"" aboard a merchant sailing vessel on a 2-year tour to California between 1834-1836. He lived ""before the mast"", meaning his quarters were up forward with the lowly grunts, where he had no special privileges, the captains and mates quarters behind the mast. Dana set out to live just like a line sailor, but also secretly document the poor conditions sailors lived under - he would go on to become a famous Boston lawyer who fought for sailors rights.What makes the book so important is that Danas book is the first to describe California, very few Americans had ever been to California. He went from port to port and details a lot about specific places like San Diego, San Francisco, Monterey, etc.. in the 1830s these ""ports"", at the largest, were settlements of a few hundred Mexicans and Indians and utter wilderness around. San Francisco had one American, and one building. When gold was found the 49ers went west and Danas book was the bible for what California was like. When Dana returned to San Francisco in 1856, it was a city of over 100,000 and he was famous, just about everyone in the city had read it. The descriptions of places just before the mass migrations began, while it was still wilderness, are fascinating. The last chapter fast forwards 24 years later as a postscript when Dana returns to California and describes his own astonishment at the modern changes, and recounts what happened to all the people he knew along the way."

The characters are well drawn, and their motivations are authentic. An FBI investigator, Terry McCaleb, gets drawn into a case because his transplanted heart was harvested from a murder victim. McCaleb is fanatical about fighting evildoers. It's a mission, a calling. He feels rage and joy when engaged hunting down and destroying evil. This is ultimately a story of redemption.The technical stuff is absorbing. It's one of the strangest cases any crime writer has yet devised. McCaleb learns that the victims were not randomly murdered; they were prey and were stalked,Clint Eastwood directed and starred in the movie which made a major change in the identity of the killer, a change which was a disappointment for readers of the novel. The killer in the movie became obvious, and was too convenient. Michael Connelly adapted his own book for the movie so he's the guilty party.The murderer's plotting is almost too intricate to swallow, but it makes for a fascinating grabber of a story.Connelly is a master of the gripping story line that gets the reader deeply involved. Connelly says homicide detectives speak for the dead. Of the murder investigator speaking for the dead, he says, ""No other crime came with such a covenant."""

Humility: True Greatness,"“God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” —1 Peter 5:5 A battle rages within every one of us every day. It’s the clash between our sense of stubborn self-sufficiency and God’s call to recognize that we’re really nothing without Him. It’s pride versus humility. And it’s a fight we can’t win without looking repeatedly to Christ and the cross. C. J. Mahaney raises a battle cry to daily, diligently, and deliberately weaken our greatest enemy (pride) and cultivate our greatest friend (humility). His thorough examination clarifies misconceptions, revealing the truth about why God detests pride and turns His active attention to the humble. Because pride is never passive, defeating it demands an intentional attack. The blessing that follows is God’s abundant favor. “This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit.” —Isaiah 66:2, ESV God clearly states that He is drawn to the humble. He’s also clear that He opposes the proud. These two, humility and pride, cannot coexist. Where one is fostered, the other is defeated. Which will you pursue? When you acknowledge the deception of pride and intentionally humble yourself, you become free to savor abundant mercies and unlikely graces. You will find a new life is yours—a life God richly favors. A God-glorifying life you don’t want to miss.",['C.J. Mahaney'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7gVDKA2OCBsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=7gVDKA2OCBsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Humility:+True+Greatness&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Multnomah,2008-08-19,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7gVDKA2OCBsC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],34.0,1590523261,10.39,A261QY1PBZ94R3,"Locarno ""Christian, evangelist, programmer, u...",8/8,4.0,1136246400,"Biblical and Practical, not densely academic","I just finished reading Humility: True Greatness by C.J. Mahaney. Now I hope you recognize immediately the need for humility when practicing evangelism. Often times, those with whom we want to share our faith are proud, self-righteous, and independant--and it would to little good to return pride with pride! God, in the Bible, over and over again reminds us of the need to stay humble and the consequence of such. See the following references for just a few examples: James 4:6, 1 Peter 5:5, Isaiah 66:2, Proverbs 8:13, Proverbs 6:16-17, Proverbs 16:18, Mark 9:35, Mark 10:32-45, Mark 10, Philippians 2:6-11,It should be clear to the reader that no one can be a self-proclaimed expert on this topic. It is clear that shouting ""I'm way more humble than you are!"" is self-defeating. Mahaney acknowledges this--he admits he is a proud person. It is only the proud person who acknowledges his pride that is qualified to write on humility. It is only due to Mahaney's failures in being humble that he can write about the need to be humble.Humility: True Greatness is not a probing theological book nor a deeply spiritual text. It is short and sweet, beginning with a few chapters on the necessity of humility and proceeding with several chapters of practical advice on how to live out a God-pleasing life of humility.One thing that I greatly appreciated was Mahaney's high view in chapter four of the death of Christ. Christ died not merely to demonstrate the ultimate in humility, but for us also to be humbled by dying with him and then being exalted because of him. He ransomed us--sorry, captive to sin, miserable and helpless. However, at this point, it seemed that Mahaney should explicitly explain the doctrine of Christ's substitutionary atonement. For readers not clear, to know this doctrine is crucial--that Christ suffered and died primarily to take the punishment we deserved for our many sins, and to credit to us his righteousness that we could never achieve. He endured in three hours on the cross our eternity in hell, and thus saved us that we might be forgiven and be made right with God. This doctrine is key to Mahaney's point in the first half of the book yet he assumes we know it. Still, Mahaney's resolute passion to write of the cross, the cross, and the cross is needed and appreciated.The practical chapters (starting in chapter five) almost alternate between general practical pracitices--such as setting aside time to pray in the morning and evening, or to study the attributes of God--and specific, almost quirky ways, like a recommendation to play golf, today's most humbling sport. This light though not comedic approach makes the book a breath of fresh air--I felt like I was getting friendly advice on how to live out the Christian life, rather than hardcore teaching from an authority. I don't think 400 pages of this would be any more edifying than the 120 that has been presented--Mahaney knows when to keep it shortThere is a section in Chapter 9 about using appropriate words that I thought were particularly fitting for witnessing. 1 Thessalonians 5:14 gives us a hint to ""admonish, encourage, help, and be patient"" to certain people (read the verse and learn who). Mahaney directs us better to consider the needs of those we meet, not trying to impress them or convert them, but rather listening sincerely and humbly to determine their need. The purpose of your words should be to give grace to those who hear (Ephesians 4:29). Another direction, especially when witnessing to those who claim to be Christians (and may indeed be) is to never correct another wihtout reminding the person of the gospel--because correction is impossible without Christ as the corrector.Mahaney also urges us to invite others to correct us and to seek correction. I pray and ask that you hold me accountable for the things on my site.This book is highly recommended, and it will not take you long to read. Take a few hours over two days and read Humility: True Greatness and you will receive ""grace to the humble."""
The compleat angler =: Or The contemplative man's recreation,,"['Izaak Walton', 'Sir John Hawkins']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LE5DAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=LE5DAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+compleat+angler+%3D:+Or+The+contemplative+man%27s+recreation&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,1808,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LE5DAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fishing'],,B000880ZFY,,AG212WE6M4O5D,Ralph White,22/23,5.0,1133654400,"How The ""Brotherhood of the Angle"" Invites a Trout to Dinner","Three hundred fifty years ago Izaak Walton wrote of the curious blend of inner peace and giddy excitement which the amateur naturalist finds at streamside. He invites us to stroll with him through the countryside, discussing the mythology, superstition, and the science of England's aquatic fauna. It is an unrushed journey, though we often arise at sunrise, and the author introduces us to many of the local inhabitants. Indeed, if our fishing is successful, we might exchange our catch for the song of a pretty milkmaid. The Compleat Angler is a brief book, and Walton's intent is to hook the reader, and encourage him to try fishing for himself: ""I do not undertake to say all that is known...but I undertake to acquaint the Reader with many things that are not usually known to every Angler; and I shall leave gleanings and observations enough to be made out of the experience that all that love and practise this recreation, to which I shall encourage them."" Interestingly, Walton starts off on the defensive, since the fisherman's passion was even then caricatured. By the end the reader has joined the ""Brotherhood of the Angle,"" making artificial flies and enjoying the poetry of fishing: ""The jealous Trout, that low did lie, Rose at a well-dissembled fly."" To the modern ear Walton's literal belief in naturalists' old wives tales may seem humorously anachronistic, and it comprises a remarkably large part of his affection for his subject. We are also frequently reminded of the book's timeline with comments such as ""...the Royal Society have found and published lately that there be thirty and three kinds of Spiders,"" while we now know that there are thirty thousand species of Arachnids. And the Brotherhood of the Angle is a genuine fraternity to Walton, ""...I love all Anglers, they be such honest, civil, quiet men."" The prospective reader must also be disabused of the misconception that Walton was a purist for artificial lures; he strongly recommends worms, minnows, and live flies. In Walton's watery world there is no dry humor, only fresh. Following his description of the twelve most effective artificial flies he says, ""Thus you have a jury of flies likely to betray and condem all the Trouts in the river."" And here he compares the beautiful coloration of a living trout to...well, you'll see: ""Their bodies [are] adorned with such red spots, and...with black or blackish spots, as give them such an addition of natural beauty as, I think, was never given to any woman by the artificial paint or patches in which they so much pride themselves in this age."" At the risk of taking some of the surprise out of the book, I here present a sample of Walton's fishing secrets: ""Take the stinking oil drawn out of Polypody of the oak by a retort, mixed with turpentine and hive-honey, and anoint your bait therewith, and it will doubtless draw the fish to it."" I would guess that Walton wasn't much of a cook, however, and I do not recommend his recipe for eel (partially skinning it, packing the viceral cavity with nutmeg and anchovy, cutting off the head, slipping the skin back over the body, and sewing it together where the head formerly was, then barbecuing it on skewers). Walton's affection for fish and fishing extends beyond the aquatic nobility of trout and salmon, to the often ignored commoners: gudgeons, sprats, bleaks, herns, tench, roach, umber, loach, and sticklebag. And as for the importance of fishing in Walton's world: ""I envy not him that eats better meat than I do, nor him that is richer, or that wears better clothes than I do; I envy nobody but him, and him only, that catches more fish than I do."""

Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,"The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,"" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company.

For some time past vessels had been met by ""an enormous thing,"" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.",['Jules Verne'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Twenty+Thousand+Leagues+Under+the+Sea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Library of Alexandria,2020-09-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,,,B000R4SOGG,,A23HT0TNSY6LZP,comet1,0/1,5.0,1294617600,great book,"im not much of a reader and to be perfectly honest i only read this book at my wife's request. once i started this book i had a verry hard time putting it down. great and verry entertaining throughout, deffenatally a must read."

The Psychology Of Everyday Things,"Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how—and why—some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.",['Don Norman'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qBfRDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=qBfRDQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=The+Psychology+Of+Everyday+Things&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Basic Books (AZ),2013-11-05,http://books.google.com/books?id=qBfRDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Psychology+Of+Everyday+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],38.0,0465067093,26.96,AZD6DGC338YX7,"Delikiz ""Delikiz""",0/0,5.0,1018310400,Even today...,This book is a must read for everybody and anybody who wants to get into the design end of things.Should even be a mandatory read for most Product Managers!It has definitely openned up my mind and gave me very good pointers.

Divine Evil (Random House Large Print),"In this gripping novel of small-town scandal and sizzling passion, New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts tells the story of a renowned artist who confronts a mystery from her past—and finds that her family secrets have not been laid to rest. Famed sculptor Clare Kimball has commanded the attention of the New York art world, but troubling memories from childhood have drawn her home to Maryland, to the town where she grew up and where her father died so long ago in circumstances never really explained. Nothing much has changed in Emmitsboro—except Cameron Rafferty, the onetime high-school bad boy turned town sheriff. The only hint of Cam’s wild nature is the light in his eyes when he looks at Clare. In Cam’s strong arms Clare is seduced into falling in love—and into believing that her small-town world is safe. But within the dark woods of Emmitsboro, something evil is spreading its poisonous power. Now Clare must pay the price for digging up the secrets of the past . . . and confront an evil that may be unstoppable—because those who practice it believe it is divine.",['Nora Roberts'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QIiEUQYYXDkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QIiEUQYYXDkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Divine+Evil+(Random+House+Large+Print)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam,2009-07-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QIiEUQYYXDkC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],17.0,0375433775,,AB9DSDX6G5R2E,Abby Goldsmith,2/6,1.0,1168387200,This book made me stupider,"I love genre fiction, but I usually avoid the Romance genre because of its cliches.

The ending was anti-climatic. What is supposed to be a major setup for justice was fizzled out. The issue could have been addressed much earlier; instead of stringing along the reader. As the reader I anticipated much more to the face-off between Julian and Jaxx's stepfather and was bitterly disappointed.My biggest irk was the domineering ways of Julian in &quot;converting&quot; Jaxx. For an incredibly independent and strong (both physically and mentally) woman, she capitulated rather easily. No major histronics or displays of anger. The character of Jaxx could have been done so much better. Instead it left me wanting more.It must be tough for an author to continue to make the storylines fresh and interesting for the reader. How many ways can a Carpathian meet his lifemate and bond her? With this book it seems she has run out of the ways.

The Abolition of Man,,,,,,,,,,B000KXCJYM,,A1P0ZB4YAA312R,Wesley L. Janssen,14/15,5.0,1043107200,The intellectual bankruptcy of ethical relativism.,"The book contains three closely related essays on ethical relativism. As different as Eastern philosophy (Chinese and Indian) may be from Western philosophy (Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian), all seriously reasoned and internally consistent systems of ethics (i.e., morality) accept the true existence of an absolute Good. In The Abolition of Man, C.S. Lewis, a thinker deeply versed in philosophy, philology, and ancient literature, calls this universal ethical reference system 'the Tao' (borrowing a generalization from Confucius). He exposes the logical self-contradictions and the human negation of modern dogmas of moral relativism.From 'Men without Chests': ""The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts. The right defense against false sentiments is to inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of [students] we only make them easier prey to the propagandist ... a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head.""From 'The Way': ""An open mind, in questions that are not ultimate, is useful. But an open mind about the ultimate foundations either of Theoretical or of Practical Reason is idiocy. If a man's mind is open on these things, let his mouth at least be shut.""From 'The Abolition of Man': ""It is not that [propagandists of ethical relativism] are bad men. They are not men at all. Stepping outside of the Tao, they have stepped into the void. Nor are their subjects necessarily unhappy men. They are not men at all: they are artifacts. Man's final conquest has proven to be the abolition of Man.""We accept relativism in modern physics because reason has led us to it. But popularized ideas of relativism in ethics, while sometimes transparently parading as 'intellectualism' (this label attempts to discourage critical examination), must take a course which leads far from consistent logic, and which ultimately turns against itself. This book is an outstanding offering from the wonderful mind of C.S. Lewis."
The Abolition of Man,,,,,,,,,,B000IBKZBU,,A3MSB482DIB9SL,"David Zampino ""21st Century Hobbit""",10/11,5.0,977270400,Words of wisdom too often ignored,"If you are a parent, and worry about the decline of the quality of education in today's society, you must read &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;. Written 50 years ago, and eerily prophetic, CS Lewis railed against the dumbing down of education in the British school systems, from an academic standpoint, but more importantly, from the standpoint of morality and values.As is evidenced in his other non-fiction (Mere Christianity, for example) Lewis was a believer in the doctrine of Natural Law (held by Catholics and many Protestants). This doctrine recognizes that since man was created in the image of God, traces of that image still remains. The Fall of Man severely damaged the image of God in man, but did not totally destroy it. Thus, throughout human history, integral values systems still maintain cetain laws, customs, beliefs, etc. which cross beyond religious and philosophical boundaries, and are, for the most part, common to all.This is an example of Natural Law at work -- and this is precisely what the secular education structures, both in Lewis' day, and even more so today, wish to utterly destroy, and replace with the nonsensical notion of a society in which there is no foundational morality; no foundational &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;. Lewis saw it happening half a century ago -- and people did not listen. The case is even more grave today. Will people listen today?"
The Abolition of Man,,,,,,,,,,B000KXCJYM,,A3D298VI1IRQJZ,hannahf,0/2,3.0,1287964800,what is our nature?,"Lewis provides much food for thought, and I agree that he is prophetic in many ways. However, I object to his continual use of human ""nature"" as synonymous with selfish desires. Human beings have always been social creatures, and our survival depends not just on satisfying individual drives but also working together and caring for each other. This could be why some form of the Golden Rule is found throughout the world's cultures. Whereas Lewis personally ascribes the origin of morality to God, or at least an abstract Tao, in fact kindness, compassion, truthfulness, etc. may have evolved as a keys to our survival.Even ants are hard-working, cooperative, solicitous of their young, protective of their Queen, defensive of the colony, and self-sacrificing. Why do we need to ascribe these characteristics to only spiritual creatures?"
Redefining Health Care: Creating Value-Based Competition on Results,"The U.S. health care system is in crisis. At stake are the quality of care for millions of Americans and the financial well-being of individuals and employers squeezed by skyrocketing premiums-not to mention the stability of state and federal government budgets. In Redefining Health Care, internationally renowned strategy expert Michael Porter and innovation expert Elizabeth Teisberg reveal the underlying-and largely overlooked-causes of the problem, and provide a powerful prescription for change. The authors argue that participants in the health care system have competed to shift costs, accumulate bargaining power, and restrict services, rather than create value for patients. This zero-sum competition takes place at the wrong level-among health plans, networks, and hospitals-rather than where it matters most, in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of specific health conditions. Redefining Health Care lays out a breakthrough framework for redefining health care competition based on patient value. With specific recommendations for hospitals, doctors, health plans, employers, and policy makers, this book shows how to move to a positive-sum competition that will unleash stunning improvements in quality and efficiency.","['Michael E.

Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (New Accents),,,,,,,,,,B000OT81RG,,A389GIGTF53E8V,Jeff,0/0,5.0,1349568000,An Entry Point for Further Research,"For those reviewers who found this book less than commendable: you need to broaden your horizons.For me, Ong's book was an introduction into the way societies accumulate and pass on knowledge. Ong concentrates on the idea that the invention of the alphabet radically re-structured human consciousness and was responsible for the current dominance of the materialistic Western world view. Ong was a member of the Toronto School (which included Goody and McLuhan) and that school favored a strongly deterministic view. Others, including Ruth Finnegan, are more balanced. If you want to be challenged in your views of how human societies work, I highly recommend reading this book. However, I would also encourage you to explore further - oral societies are much more complex than a superficial reading of Ong would lead you to believe. Ong has a tendency to think that Western thought is the pinnacle of human achievement, but don't let that stop you from reading his work. If you hold in your mind, while reading the book, that there are other ways of passing on knowledge than alphabetic writing systems, you will be rewarded by Ong's insights. This book was written in 1982, so in some respects, it is a bit dated - there has been quite a lot of scholarly effort devoted to the field since then. If you are interested in exploring further, I would suggest that you start with Ong's excellent bibliography and look up each author on the Internet and follow those leads. You will soon find yourself in a thicket of semiotics, performance, intersubjectivity, oral tradition, and indigenous memory systems, among other topics. Ong was a brilliant scholar and I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is a rather brief overview, but if you are willing to do some work, it is an excellent starting point for further research."

Tresca,5/6,4.0,971049600,The characters are vibrant and original.,"I so enjoyed The Clan of the Cave Bear series that I wanted to read more novels in the same genre. A story about pre-historic Native Americans, People of the Wolf is set among the mammoth hunters of the ice ages. The people live in clans, and are dependent upon each other for their survival. The undisputed leaders of the clans are Dreamers--men and women who have a connection with the spirit world. The spirits advise them in Dreams, and help them lead their clans. The people must be careful to keep the spirits, happy, of course, or they may abandon the Dreamer or the clan. But what happens when two dreamers in the same clan have differing opinions? The people are forced to choose between the young man with the Dream of Wolf in his eyes and the trusted older Dreamer who may be past his prime. One will lead them to a new land of abundance and promise, the other will lead them to death by slow starvation.The couple who wrote the novel are anthropologists who obviously know about the lives and customs of the people they portray. Free of the annoying stereotypes that often accompany these topics, the characters are vibrant and original. Even if you've never been a fan of Native American history or novels of pre-history (and I never thought I would be!) you may find yourself loving this book."

Don't waste your money!,"Awful, awful, awful! I would have given it zero stars, but that wasn't an option. The book is read MUCH TOO FAST for a child to follow along and turn the pages. The page turn signal is a tiny bell that is hard to hear and so short it gives no time to separate the pages and turn them. By the time a child gets the page turned, the reader is 4 or 5 pages ahead because they are also reading SO FAST! This could have been a really good book for an audio read along because the print is large and the words are simple and rhyming, but it is read so quickly a child just learning to read doesn't even have the chance to determine which word is being read. My 4 year old loves read along books but became so frustrated with this book he didn't want to ever read it again. Extremely disappointing as a parent and discouraging for a beginning reader. The Curious George read along series is so much better, although it doesn't have the large text or simple words. Curious George is read with interesting inflections and gives children sufficient time to follow along and turn the pages themselves. Save your money and don't buy this Dr. Seuss series."
The Last of the Mohicans,"Presented for the first time as an illustrated novel—with unabridged text—experience anew the war for control of the New World in this classic tale by James Fenimore Cooper. The wild rush of action in this classic frontier adventure novel has made The Last of the Mohicans the most popular of James Fenimore Cooper’s “Leatherstocking Tales.” Deep in the forests of upper New York State, the brave woodsman Hawkeye—Natty Bumppo—and his loyal Mohican friends Chingachgook and Uncas become embroiled in the bloody battles of the French and Indian War. The abduction of the beautiful Munro sisters by hostile savages; the treachery of the renegade brave Magua; the ambush of innocent settlers; and the thrilling events that lead to the final, tragic confrontation between rival war parties create an unforgettable, spine-tingling picture of life on the frontier. At the center of the novel is the infamous massacre of British troops and their families by Indian allies of the French at Fort William Henry in 1757. Around this historical event, Cooper builds a romantic fiction of captivity, sexuality, and heroism, in which the destiny of the Mohican Chingachgook and his son Uncas is inseparable from the lives of Alice and Cora Munro and of Hawkeye the frontier scout.

The Indian guide leads them off trial and they wander around the wilderness until two other Indians, Uncas and Chicangook, as well as their white companion Hawk -Eye, decide to guide them to their destination. Along the way the travelers go through everything from a battle to two separate kidnappings. Overall the story was enjoyable but It dragged on several hundred pages longer than it had to be.In short, I recommend ""The Last of the Mohicans"" to a true fan of 1800 era war and Native stories who have enough time on their hands to read the 430 page novel and enjoy the language used some 200 years ago."

New and Selected Poems: v. 1,"Understand, I am always trying to figure out what the soul is, and where hidden, and what shape- New and Selected Poems, Volume Two, an anthology of forty-two new poems-an entire volume in itself-and sixty-nine poems hand-picked by Mary Oliver from six of her last eight books, is a major addition to a career in poetry that has spanned nearly five decades. Now recognized as an unparalleled poet of the natural world, Mary Oliver writes with unmatched dexterity and a profound appreciation for the divergence and convergence of all living things. Mary Oliver is always searching for the soul of things. In poem after poem, her investigations go from the humble green bean that nourishes her and makes her wonder if ""something/-I can't name it-watches as I walk the/rows, accepting the gift of their lives/to assist mine"" to the vast, untouchable bliss of ""things you can't reach./But you can reach out to them, and all day long./The wind, the bird flying away./The idea of God."" Oliver's search grows and is informed by experience, meditation, perception, and discernment. And all the while, during her quest, she is constantly surprised and fortified by joy. This graceful volume, designed to be paired with New and Selected Poems, Volume One, includes new poems on birds, toads, flowers, insects, bodies of water, and the extraordinary experience of the everyday in our lives. In the words of Alicia Ostriker,'Mary Oliver moves by instinct, faith, and determination. She is among our finest poets, and still growing.' In both the older and new poems, Mary Oliver is a poet at the height of her control of image and language.",['Mary Oliver'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CErFfdNS8hEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=CErFfdNS8hEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=New+and+Selected+Poems:+v.+1&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Beacon Press,2005-10-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=CErFfdNS8hEC&dq=New+and+Selected+Poems:+v.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Poetry'],9.0,B000K2ICIU,,A2MHQQ5J2MKQYV,Daniel L.

How the Other Half Lives,"How the Other Half Lives was a pioneering work of photojournalism by Jacob Riis, documenting the squalid living conditions in New York City slums in the 1880s. It served as a basis for future muckraking journalism by exposing the slums to New York City's upper and middle class. How The Other Half Lives quickly became a landmark in the annals of social reform. Riis documented the filth, disease, exploitation, and overcrowding that characterized the experience of more than one million immigrants. He helped push tenement reform to the front of New York's political agenda, and prompted then-Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt to close down the police-run poor houses. Roosevelt later called Riis ""the most useful citizen of New York"". Riis's idea inspired Jack London to write a similar exposé on London's East End, called People of the Abyss.",['Jacob August Riis'],,http://books.google.com/books?id=4ouDQgAACAAJ&dq=How+the+Other+Half+Lives&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2009-10-02,http://books.google.com/books?id=4ouDQgAACAAJ&dq=How+the+Other+Half+Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Poor'],,B000OY2PAU,,A127B67SDWCONL,"Vincent D. Pisano ""Stillborn Messiah""",9/9,4.0,1210636800,A classic work that still holds power,"Few books in American history have had the social impact that Jacob A. Riis's How the Other Half Lives had. Riis spent years crawling through the slums of New York's Lower East Side in the later half of the nineteenth-century, always with a local guide sympathetic to his cause. He hoped, through the evolving technological advances of photography and his published, emotional plea, to rouse the well-to-do citizens of New York into helping the millions of poor and impoverished, native and immigrant alike, which continued to swell the city's population. In order for them to have had the chance of becoming productive American citizens, they must first have been given the opportunity at a fair start, which the abject state of the tenement buildings were unable to provide.The first problem was the tenement itself. Usually a building, four to six stories high, intended for the occupancy of just a few families, soon had over a hundred people packed into every nook that could fill a human body. Most interior rooms never saw the light of day. Fresh air was a rare commodity, leaving most residents to breathe the same stale air day and night. The maze of tight, blind passageways created to fit each family made it impossible for firemen to reach helpless victims trapped on the upper floors, compounded by the fact that most fire escapes were blocked with residents' furniture, trapping more even still. Overall, the filth of the structures proved most offensive to the senses. One such building was so dubbed the ""Dirty Spoon"" because the grime on the walls had effectively made it fire proof (Riis 30). Rear tenements, built in empty courts behind the street buildings, were usually worse, little more than dilapidated hovels cut off from light by the surrounding structures.Despite this vision of abject poverty, and indeed starvation was prevalent, many in the tenements were not what would have been considered poor. Some, in fact, earned a decently living for the era. So why didn't they move? The real question to be asked is, to where would they move? Tenement houses were the norm in New York, each as good (or lousy) as the next. Additionally, the rents paid by most of these residents (especially blacks) were very high, often amounting to more than a week's wage. Only the abundantly wealthy could afford better, while the middle and lower classes were left to the stink of places like ""The Bend"" on Mulberry Street, which Riis considers the heart of slum depravity.Predictably, these conditions bred all types of criminal activity. Faced with constant hunger and only the streets to call home, many resorted to gang violence or controlled substance dependency. Children, who sometimes never saw beyond their squalid block, with a family that could not provide for their basic needs, soon created gangs of their own, making their way as they could. Other children toiled with their families in the sweatshops, for which the tenements were the main housing. Perhaps the most regrettable victims of the tenements were the infants, who were regularly victims of abandonment, left on wealthy doorsteps with vain hopes by desperate parents, or given up to ""Baby-farms"" where they were left to starve to death (Riis 148). These conditions Riis blames squarely on tenements: ""The product is our own"" (Riis 171).However, all hope was not lost to Riis. Already airshafts had been implemented in new building designs to allow ventilation (to what effect can be debated) and new windows punched into walls, so that ""air and sunlight"" could ""have a legal claim"" (Riis 211). Rear tenements, too, were quickly disappearing. He felt that by writing How the Other Half Lives, the wealthy and influential of the city would come to the aid (Riis 131). In this respect he was correct, when through his book he found an ally in Theodore Roosevelt, who began implementing many of the suggestions that Riis proposed. He urged people to look beyond the building facades (which were admittedly nice on some buildings) to the teeming filth that they masked (Riis 209). Perhaps the most intimidating argument for his more fortunate peers was the possibility of spreading disease, for to him public sentiment had ""slumbered peacefully until... a dreaded epidemic knocked at our door"" (Riis 212). He called for laws to be imposed against the current tenement conditions, for the buildings to be renovated or new ""model tenements"" built in their place (Riis 223). Likewise, tenants should have received the quality accommodations their high rents were entitling them to. Riis endorsed the park system (City-Beautiful influence?) as a way of relieving crime in congested districts, for reasons such as this elegant observation: ""I have seen an armful of daisies keep the peace of a block better than a policeman and his club, seen instincts awaken under their gentle appeal"" (Riis 138). Children, Riis felt, were the ""key"" to rescuing the city from poverty and corruption (Riis 143).The other contribution for which Riis has been immortalized, and no doubt thanked repeatedly by modern historians, is the treasure trove of photos he took while on his outings, one hundred of which are found in the Dover edition. (His original publication did not include the photos for technological reasons). The impact of the strikingly bleak images caught on film far outweighs any of the emotional condemnations he wrote. The reader, thankfully, is also treated to many of the stories behind these images, adding yet another dimension, such as the young paupers on page 157 who claimed that they ""Didn't live nowhere."" Another, probably unintentional, effective element to the photos is the pained grimace on many faces (like the ""Street Arab"" on page 152), as though they are writhing in agony from hunger, although it is no doubt just a reaction from the camera's blinding flash in dark quarters. The street dwellers and criminals, even those presumably embarrassed by their situations, seem willing to have their pictures taken. Perhaps it is the only such opportunity many had.Despite Riis's commendable crusading and fight for the underprivileged, he was still in many ways a man of his time. The modern reader cannot help but be struck by the prejudices running through his commentary. The groups that receive the most of the brunt are the Italians and Polish Jews. The Chinese also pay a price for their differences, and Riis tells us that his ""senseless idolatry, a mere grub-worship"" have made nothing strong about him, except his passions when aroused"" (Riis 77) and speaks of opium addiction as a form of white slavery (Riis 80). At least he commends them for being clean. Surprisingly, however, he looks fondly on African-Americans (along with Bohemians), who he treats with sympathetic respect. He sees their hardships, and the causes (ironically), that ""the blame is born by prejudice and greed that have kept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could hardly be equal"" under those circumstances. That after only twenty-five years of freedom, he ""may be seen to advance much farther and faster than before suspected, and to promise, with fair treatment, quite as well as the rest of us, his white-skinned fellow-citizens"" (Riis 119). When he wished, it seems, Riis was quite able to see beyond differences.Riis, through How the Other Half Lives, awakened a society that had once turned a blind eye to the hardships prevalent in the tenements. He showed them effectively that the struggle was not theirs alone, but that its reach was felt for many miles in ways not readily apparent. His photographic images, forever capturing the lowest moments in people's lives, begged for intervention. Whatever Riis's shortcomings, future generations in New York and cities around the country would be better off because of what he did, and benefit from the experiences of those who did not live long enough to see those changes occur. Unfortunately, the images in Riis's work are still a common sight in many developing countries, making his century-old ideas of relevant, present power."

Unlike Tom Seaver's post-World Series effort, Clendenon's book had a lot to say, and said it with lots of candor. The level of detail was remarkable, as was the breadth of topics.The beginning of the book demonstrated just how difficult it was to be an African-American baseball player in the early 1960s, when teams had self-imposed quotas. I'm still not sure this is a widely-known fact. Breaking in with the Pirates, Clendenon revealed, was difficult when their complement of black players was limited to ""Roberto Clemente and his Spanish-speaking roommate"".Clendenon also did not end the story with a freeze-frame after Game 5 of the World Series. His post-baseball law degree, personal troubles, and illnesses received equal attention and candor.I had the opportunity to see Donn at a book signing on Long Island shortly after ""Miracle"" came out. He spoke with dignity and inner strength.He will most certainly be missed."

Her wealthy father owned a lot of land which he shared with their servants. He and was very generous and well-loved. It all changed when Esperanza's father was murdered by bandits when he was in the fields. Later Esperanza's uncles (a banker and the mayor of her home town) came and the banker said Esperanza's mother (Mama) couldn't own the land because she was a woman and he wanted her to marry him. Mama said ""No"". Their house and stables burnt down and Mama felt like she had to now say ""yes"" to the proposal but instead they ran away to California, where the only place that they could go to was a Mexican work camp. Esperanza now had a lot to deal with, like her grandmother was left behind in Mexico, her mother fell sick and she has to work now but she doesn't even know how to use a broom to sweep! Can Esperanza rise above it all?I like how the author says that Esperanza Ortega was real (She was the author's grandmother!)!! I really liked the story line and the Miguel character. I like Miguel because he is a good friend but he is also like most boys. Esperanza Rising won many awards including the Pura Belpre Medal, the Jane Addams Peace Award, an ALA Top Ten Best Book for Young Adults, and the Americas Award Honor Book. The copy I have has an AFTER WORDS bonus section at the end of the book which has things like an interview with the author (Pam Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan), two chapters from Ms. Mu&ntilde;oz Ryan's book ""Becoming Naomi Le&oacute;n"", a recipe for a Mexican punch and how to make a yarn doll. I like how the story has funny sections even though the topic is pretty serious. Esperanza wasn't the typical ""rich bratty kid"" she is very likeable and has a good attitude to keep trying."

I felt sad for Esperanza some many times especially when her mother got sick and she had to work in order to buy her medicines. While being in the United States, my mother has been sick and I have sent money to her to pay the medical bills.I also loved the use of Spanish language in the book. The first Mexican proverbs at the beginning of the book, gives you a powerful glimpse of the wisdom from our Latino American ancestors. The author kept the use of Spanish especially in the very important expressions.This is a story some many people can feel related to it.

Changing Ideals in Modern Architecture 1750-1950,"Changing Ideals in Modern Architecture revolutionized the understanding of modernism in architecture, pushing back the sense of its origin from the early twentieth century to the 1750s and thus placing architectural thought within the a broader context of Western intellectual history.

This book was published in 1965, barely pre-dating the publication of Venturi's influential ""Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture."" Now that I've read both, if I had to recommend one, I would recommend Peter Collins. While Venturi attacks Modernism by simply saying ""its not complicated enough, I like complex architecture (and therefore you should too)"" Collins goes much, much more in-depth.The various ideas architects have desperately flung around since 1750 are all traced, dissected, and put into their social contexts. Rationalism, Romanticism, Ecclecticism, Historicism/Archeology, Classics versus Goths, the Moderns, the various analogies to other fields architects have attempted - it is all discussed. The book stops at 1950, but this does not detract from its relevance in 2004, as we can see that architects have continued to explore connections with other genres in order to create their various forms. It is important to realize what we're doing and if it has ever be done before - and - it all pretty much has been. Not to despair though, Collins keeps it an interesting read, if you do not chuckle at his wit every now and then, then your sense of humor is dead. It is important to read this critically, and I found myself only very occasionally disagreeing.One of my favorite chapters, which is almost a six-page long joke, is entitled ""Architecture and Gastronomy."" (and yet - it is not a joke!)The only criticism of the book is perhaps his less-intensive use of illustrations than he might have. Those that he does include however are well-chosen.A very closely related work to this is J. Mordaunt Crook's 1987 ""The Dilemma of Style: Architectural Ideas from the Picturesque to the Post Modern."" Crook makes a book that attempts to do essentially the same thing, but has a slightly diferent perspective. I mention it because I believe these two, Crook and Collins, should be read by any architect worth their salt.Kenneth Frampton writes a fairly interesting introduction to the 1998 edition, hopefully this book will continue to have stamina for future generations of architects."

Having lost a child, she feels deeply burdened with the guilt of the death, her feelings of failure as a mother, even her regret that she could not procure a more elaborate grave marker for her dear baby. When a mysterious girl arrives, seeming to embody the ghostly spirit of the lost child, Sethe clings to the girl in an attempt to salvage some forgiveness for her past sins. As the girl grows stronger every day, she seems to leach Sethe's own spirit and Sethe withers away, to the sorrow of her friends and loved ones.The rich symbolism is so heavily redolent of Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter, only here the shame is directed (however unfairly) inwardly, rather than from outside forces. ""Beloved"" is, at the heart of it, a wonderful novel of how destructive our guilt and pain can be, when we allow it purchase.~ Ana Mardoll"

Deep in South America, Delanie Eastman braves high and low to locate her missing sister Lauren who was previously linked to the virulent drug-lord Ramon Montero. Assuming her dumb blonde persona, she enters the lion's den as Montero's interest. Little did she expect her plans to explode when Dr. Kyle Wright, her one-night stand years ago to appear as Montero's assassin. He has a secret agenda - to save the world from Montero's destructive plans in bioterrorism. Together Delanie and Kyle are gripped by treachery, propelled into present danger and even a frigid and emotional passion....What action and high-flying passion! HIDE AND SEEK blends seamlessly propulsive drama and rollicking adventures as they survived through anacondas, piranhas, bugging devices and even the evil Isabella, a prostitution ringleader. Delanie is endearingly vulnerable yet a suitable candidate as Charlie's Angel with her ballet kicks. Kyle is a sexy and strong hero, fierce in his passion. Their chemistry is a exploding effervescence, especially in the sex department. HIDE AND SEEK is blazingly sensual and explicit.In all its cloak of fast wits and cynical humour, HIDE and SEEK no doubt loses its predecessor's warmth and tenderness. Yet it reigns as this year's best contemporary romance so far. The heart-stopping action and steamy sex is enough to justify Ms. Adair's uncompromising talents in scripting a good read."

The stories generally are linked by family lines (ie. the ancestor of the character in the previous story is a character in the later story). While following these family lines the stories also chronicle the developments of many world religions and especially Judaism, Muslim, and Christianity.

An Acquaintance with Darkness,"A teenage orphan is caught up in President Lincoln’s assassination—and another macabre plot—in this “fast-paced and dramatic” historical novel (Publishers Weekly). Emily’s mother always told her that she should avoid Uncle Valentine, a doctor, that he was involved in things she shouldn’t know about. But after Emily is orphaned—as Washington, DC, is in chaos due to the end of the Civil War—she has nowhere else to go. Now, in addition to coping with the loss of her mother, the fourteen-year-old finds herself involved in two mysteries. First, she wonders about her best friend, Annie Surratt, and the Surratt family. Annie has a signed picture of the handsome actor John Wilkes Booth in her room—but there seems to be more of a connection between Booth and the Surratt family than Emily thought…possibly including the plot to kill Lincoln. At the same time, Uncle Valentine’s odd behavior leads Emily to suspect that he is involved with body-snatching. As dark secrets swirl around her, Emily must figure out who she can trust, in this suspenseful tale “with a wealth of interesting background information” (Publishers Weekly). “Rinaldi has woven two interesting plots here into a fine coming-of-age historical novel....Makes readers feel as if they are living in history.”—Booklist “A vivid account of the moral ambiguities surrounding body snatching—for medical research—at the close of the Civil War.”—Publishers Weekly",['Ann Rinaldi'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=n7pZoaYwIzsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=n7pZoaYwIzsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=An+Acquaintance+with+Darkness&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2005-03-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n7pZoaYwIzsC&source=gbs_api,['Young Adult Fiction'],8.0,015201294X,16.0,,,0/0,5.0,901238400,A Book You Won't Want to Put Down!

That something lies in Jenny. I liked Oliver but could not warm up to Jenny. I think Segal was too concerned with making her comments very sharp. He did not spend enough time on developing her character. It was hard for me to believe that Oliver could fall in love with her and even harder to comprehend is her supposed love for him. That said, the story is extremely powerful, sad and profound, like all love stories should be.When other writers write a love story, they include other characters who are just as important as the lovers and there is always a back story to the love story. Segal is able to strip away all that and just leaves us what we want to read in every story -- a love story. He does not go into elaborate descriptions that enhance some other authors' stories. He builds up his story from simple sentences and fundamental emotions that stir people's heart.To elaborate, I do not mean that I want Jenny to be different. I am perfectly happy with the way she is but the goal of Segal should have been making readers care about Jenny which he did not do well enough. The ending was sad and profound but did not make me want to cry. &quot;Oliver's Story&quot; did that. I think everyone should read &quot;Oliver's Story&quot; first and then re-read &quot;Love Story&quot;. They will be moved more."

I feel they succeeded with flying colors. I hope Michael Melcher, Faith Adiele, Bennett Singer and Julia Sullivan will keep me informed of any future novels."
Fair Play,"A REESE'S BOOK CLUB PICK ""A hands-on, real talk guide for navigating the hot-button issues that so many families struggle with.""--Reese Witherspoon Tired, stressed, and in need of more help from your partner? Imagine running your household (and life!) in a new way... It started with the Sh*t I Do List. Tired of being the ""shefault"" parent responsible for all aspects of her busy household, Eve Rodsky counted up all the unpaid, invisible work she was doing for her family -- and then sent that list to her husband, asking for things to change. His response was... underwhelming. Rodsky realized that simply identifying the issue of unequal labor on the home front wasn't enough: She needed a solution to this universal problem. Her sanity, identity, career, and marriage depended on it. The result is Fair Play: a time- and anxiety-saving system that offers couples a completely new way to divvy up chores and responsibilities. Rodsky interviewed more than five hundred men and women from all walks of life to figure out what the invisible work in a family actually entails and how to get it all done efficiently. With four easy-to-follow rules, 100 household tasks, and a series of conversation starters for you and your partner, Fair Play helps you prioritize what's important to your family and who should take the lead on every chore from laundry to homework to dinner. ""Winning"" this game means rebalancing your home life, reigniting your relationship with your significant other, and reclaiming your Unicorn Space -- as in, the time to develop the skills and passions that keep you interested and interesting. Stop drowning in to-dos and lose some of that invisible workload that's pulling you down. Are you ready to try Fair Play? Let's deal you in.",['Eve Rodsky'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cV6IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cV6IDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fair+Play&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2019-10-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cV6IDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],4.0,0425194574,7.99,AINRTJ8VUFDAV,"Donna K.

Because of this, he feels that he can't turn down the offer of a chance to fill in for a divinity professor at Harvard for a semester. Surprisingly, big-city girl Faith feels sad to pull up her roots from Aleford, if only for a little while. When she reaches their house in Cambridge, she feels a sense of foreboding, as if something mysterious has happened there at one time. Her feelings prove to be true when she finds a diary written by a woman who was literally held as a prisoner by her husband in the house in the 1940's. Meanwhile Faith encounters an old boyfriend named Richard at a homeless shelter and he tells her that he is doing undercover research for a new book he is writing. She begins to meet with Richard and does not tell her husband Tom about the meetings. This particular plot twist did not sit well with this reader, particularly since Faith is very vocal about her jealousy over one of Tom's female graduate students who becomes friendlier to him than Faith would like. Eventually the questions brought up by the diary and by Richard's presence are answered, and this latest &quot;Body&quot; book ends with some of Faith's favorite recipes.

'How?' you ask? Who cares? Flint gives some far-future science fiction explanation. Most of the town's residents conclude that the 'Ring of Fire' is simply an Act of God.But the question of how Grantville comes to seventeenth century Germany is not important. All that matters is what happens once the heavily armed town finds itself thirteen years into the Thirty Years' War, one of the most destructive religious conflicts in the history of Europe. Surrounded on all sides by hostile countries and marauding armies, mere survival is the town's chief concern. Grantville's modern weapons might be - barely - sufficient to hold off the ragtag bands of looters and mercenaries roaming the countryside. But if one of the major powers striving for supremacy over Central Europe decides to crush the town, Grantville will not be able to resist them on its own.So the residents of Grantville decide to fight fire with fire and kick off the American Revolution a century and a half ahead of schedule. Grantville's only hope of survival lies in finding allies willing to tolerate democracy and religious pluralism, while at the same time recruiting those of their new neighbors who are sick and tired of being slaughtered by their aristocrats or for their religion. The early seventeenth century, with (on the one hand) feudalism and religion discredited by bloody warfare, persecution and oppression and (on the other) modern theories of representative government and rule of law just beginning to rear their heads, offers the slim possibility that Grantville will be able to pull through.All this makes for a fast-paced and highly entertaining story. Flint, before this book best known for military science fiction, spends a lot of time on battle scenes, but still tries to focus on the power of ideas and ordinary people to change the world. Character development is better than normal for the genre, though still not great. Some characters, especially the sinister industrialist Tom Simpson, remain one-dimensional. Flint, who got a Master's Degree in African history before spurning the ivory tower to go into union organizing, often interrupts the narrative with brief history lessons, which I personally found interesting.Although &quot;1632&quot; was originally written as a stand-alone novel, it was so popular that Flint was convinced to expand the story into a full-blown alternate history series, which continues in &quot;1633&quot; (coauthored with David Weber) and the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; anthology. This means that even though there are more volumes for those who enjoy &quot;1632,&quot; this book still comes to a satisfying conclusion and can be read on its own, without commitment to the larger series. Those who are still uncertain should know that Baen offers the book for free on its Web site, so the curious can check it out. There's really no reason not to."

""ccjello""",1/1,4.0,1231286400,useful guide for applying principles of the enneagram to understand the workplace,"Sometimes it is difficult to understand the hows and whys of the workplace -- why we invariably expect and meet resistance from our bosses to certain initiatives, why some actions are met by praise, others by criticism or even indifference, why one boss wants you to critique his ideas, while another is offended by anything remotely challenging. When we view the rest of the world through our own self-created, self-biased lens and are unable to imagine the view from the eyes of another, we will always be limited in our ability to make sense of it all.I've found the enneagram to be extremely useful in understanding myself, others, and interaction between people. The enneagram posits that folks fall into one of nine basic personality types (or styles or worldviews), each with its own natural gifts and limitations (ennea= nine in Greek). A person typically acts in a manner consistent with her personality type, interpreting information and dealing with obstacles in a manner consistent with the personality type. When you come to understand a person's enneagram type, you can better anticipate their actions and understand the why's behind their actions. Trying to make sense of others' behavior without understanding their worldview often leads to frustration and rarely leads to an accurate understanding. Realizing that others don't approach the world in the same way makes it easier to understand and ultimately work productively with others.The nine enneagram types as labeled by the author are:1. Perfectionist (rule-follower, goody two shoes, wants to get things right)2. Helper (care-taker, derives great self-worth from helping others)3. Producer (achiever, wants to be ""successful"" as traditionally defined)4. Connoisseur (artist, romantic, free spirit, want to be authentic and express their true feelings)5. Sage (professor, know-it-all, likes to hoard objective information)6. Troubleshooter (skeptic, worry-wart)7. Visionary (fun-seeker, adventurer, wants a range of possibilities, excitement)8. Top Dog (dictator, general)9. Mediator (peacemaker)In a work environment, for example, a seven visionary boss may be big on brainstorming, tossing out many ideas without first thinking them through, will start many projects but not always follow through. As fast as the seven visionary can put ideas on the table and create possibilities, the six troubleshooter will counter with objections, detailing every possible problem that might arise. The one perfectionist will be focused on whether the ideas conform to the rules -- is this idea consistent with our SOP? Does this align with the company's mission statement? Can we run this by the proper channels before discussing further? The four connoisseur will reject the mundane, and will wonder how others will feel if the idea is implemented. The five won't care so much how others feel about implementation, but will want to collect as much objective data as possible about the idea. The two helper will be busy taking notes or getting coffee or making sure that everyone has had a turn to speak. The eight is grumbling because he's not the boss, and will support an idea as long as he gets to be project leader and run things his way.Once you get a sense of a person's enneagram type, you can better understand their behaviors. Why does a certain person ALWAYS come up with a laundry list of reasons not to proceed with a new process, why are they rarely supportive of change in the beginning? Because they're a six, and their world view is to be a skeptic. Why is one boss visibly offended when you fail to acknowledge his superior ranking in the corporate pecking order (because he's an eight) while another boss is more concerned with helping you achieve your own career goals (because he's a two).This book is chock-full of examples of how the enneagram plays out in the workplace. It also gives very specific rules for working with each of the types, as well as tips for performance with each of the types. For example, when working with an agenda-driven, achievement-focused three, you need to make an appointment, be prepared and organized, define success, outline target deadlines, and stay on course. Threes set goals and follow through to achieve those goals. When working with a four, on the other hand, focusing on setting rigid goals and marching along without reflection simply to achieve those goals is a recipe for disaster. For fours, the process is often more important than the specific goal. Fours are prone to take things personally and give up easily -- so bluntness and abrupt communication can cause fours to disengage. Eights, on the other hand, want things to be black & white. When you're dealing with an eight, be on time, get to the point, be direct, show respect. Eight bosses want you to follow their orders without question, without objection. They don't want to hear objections once a decision has been made. In contrast, a four boss wants to ensure that all of the ramifications of a decision have been well-vetted. A four boss is much more likely to appreciate creativity and curiosity; a four boss generally wonders what isn't being voiced when things are presented as clear-cut, black and white. Telling a two not to worry can be reassuring. In contrast, telling a six not to worry can quickly undermine your credibility. Much better to acknowledge a six's concern as legitimate and seek ways to address it.The bottom line is that people are motivated differently, make decisions differently, and interact with others differently.I trust that there are enneagram skeptics who think you can't just slap a label on a person and use that label to explain everything about the person. It is simplistic to say that everyone in the world can be pigeon-holed into one of nine categories and that explains all. That said, for the most part, most people are internally consistent with one of the enneagram types. A two will generally treat others in a certain way (helpful), be motivated in a certain way (recognition for helpfulness), learn in a certain way. A three will generally treat others in a certain way (goal-focused, how can this person help me achieve my goal) and be motivated by certain things (top sales award, best student award, anything the looks like a certificate or trophy). A one will obey the rules even if the rules don't make sense; a four will question whether the rules make sense and try to create rules that do make sense, and eight wants you to follow his rules. Period. And although the labels aren't the complete guide to understading everything about the workplace, they are a useful starting point."

The damage that a fasle accusation from CPS leaves behind is also abuse. Many are quick to judge and believe that CPS can do no wrong. I USED to be one of those people.

The book effectively covers history and politics as well as human emotions.

It's worth reading, though it's not quite as intelligent, intricate, or suspenseful as his debut novel. I'm not sure if he dumbed this one down slightly on purpose, or if the bar was just set extremely high by his impressive showing with the previous book. Either way, this book was certainly enjoyable, though probably not a book I will remember years from now.One thing Liss has going for him is that he seems to have cornered the market on an intriguing literary niche - the European historical/financial mystery. If there's anyone out there writing in this same sub-genre, they certainly aren't doing it as well as him. While there is nothing particularly profound about his writing, he does have a talent for capturing a period in a way that feels authentic. With a slightly more simplistic plot, I think his novels would adapt nicely into movies. There is so much flavor to them, the reader can easily visualize the sets and the costumes that would be used.There's also something very readable about his prose style. It has a European whimsical feel to it that makes his writing very pleasant to absorb.The plot here has just enough characters and twists to keep it interesting, though not so complicated that you'll have to jot down key facts to remember what is going on. It borders on bubblegum fiction, but Liss is intelligent enough to keep it elevated just a notch above that level."

You should get a workout several times a week, especially if you're an office-chair potato. The book only covers the nutrient portion of a diet, but remember, the body is a whole package.

Among Schoolchildren (Signed),"The Pulitzer Prize–winning author’s classic, “brilliantly illuminated” account of education in America (TheNew York Times Book Review). Mrs. Zajac is feisty, funny, and tough. She likes to call herself an “old-lady teacher.” (She is thirty-four.) Around Kelly School, she is infamous for her discipline: “She is mean, bro,” says one of her students. But children love her, and so will the reader of this extraordinarily moving book by the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of House and The Soul of a New Machine. Tracy Kidder spent nine months in Mrs. Zajac’s fifth-grade classroom in a depressed area of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Living among the twenty schoolchildren and their indomitable teacher, he shared their joys, catastrophes, and small but essential triumphs. His resulting New York Times bestseller is a revelatory and remarkably poignant account of an inner-city school that “erupts with passionate life,” and a close-up examination of what is wrong—and right—with education in America (USA Today). “More than a book about needy children and a valiant teacher; it is full of the author’s genuine love, delight and celebration of the human condition.

Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid,Publisher Description,"['Gabriele Giuliani', 'Giovanni Vignale']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kFkIKRfgUpsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=kFkIKRfgUpsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Quantum+Theory+of+the+Electron+Liquid&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Cambridge University Press,2005-03-31,http://books.google.com/books?id=kFkIKRfgUpsC&dq=Quantum+Theory+of+the+Electron+Liquid&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Science'],,B000N662JO,,A3EQQP0LD4Z375,Dr. Lee D. Carlson,8/10,5.0,1128729600,An outstanding job,"Written with the student in mind, this book gives an excellent introduction to density functional theory, many-body quantum theory, and their application to the physical system now known as the electron liquid. Given the current interest in electron liquids, both from an applied and a theoretical standpoint, this book serves a need for those who want to educate themselves on the different techniques and strategies used to study the behavior of electron liquids, and general many-body systems. The authors of the book emphasize modern developments, and give many references for those readers who want to pursue the subject in even more detail. An understanding of both the physical and mathematical ideas in the book require concentrated effort, but anyone who has decided to read such a sizable book realizes that true insight into any subject only comes from such an effort. The authors understand this, and they do not hesitate to elaborate on sophisticated concepts when they arise. But they also interject informal and colloquial language in many places in the text. This serves to set the reader more at ease, and makes for even more enjoyable reading.Readers (such as this reviewer) who have a background in high energy physics or relativistic quantum field theory will find many of the concepts used in these fields find application in the theory of electron liquids. In addition, many of the concepts used in high-energy physics, such as the idea of spontaneously broken symmetries, arose in condensed matter and many-body physics. The symbiosis of ideas between these different fields has been a fruitful one and this will no doubt continue in the years to come. An example of this is the Chern-Simons theory, which arose in the context of quantum chromodynamics as a theory of the strong interaction, and finds its way in this book in the discussion on the Laughlin theory of the fractional quantum Hall liquid. This theory, as the authors point out, is based on a careful choice of wave functions, and therefore cannot be viewed as systematic in its strategy in finding solutions. The Chern-Simons theory is brought in to provide a more systematic approach. It is a fascinating strategy, for using it one maps the problem of the two-dimensional electron liquid into an equivalent many-body problem of interacting composite particles. One can then use a mean-field approximation on the latter system. This approach is somewhat similar to the ""duality"" phenomena found in string theories (although the analogy is somewhat loose). The Chern-Simon theory also finds its place in purely mathematical contexts, such as topological quantum field theory and the theory of knots, and readers with a background in this area will see familiar constructions in the author's discussions. The authors derive an expression for the electromagnetic response function for a system of composite particles that satisfies Kohn's theorem, but point out that it does not have the correct scaling properties.The authors give a thorough overview of density functional theory, with emphasis placed not only on the formalism but also on its utility in solving many-body problems. Readers growing up in the usual formalism of Hilbert spaces will need justification as to the power of density functional methods and how one can still calculate quantities of interest without really using the many-body wave function. And, anyone who has tried to perform numerical computations of quantum-mechanical quantities understands the need for algorithms that are manageable, i.e. that allow the computation of physical quantities in a reasonable time scale. The authors point out though that the Kohn-Sham equations, which result after the minimization of the energy as a functional of the electron density, can be solved computationally on a time scale that increases as a power of the number of electrons. This is to be contrasted with the computation of the solution of the N-electron Schrodinger equation, which depends exponentially on N. However, as in all problems in constrained optimization, there is no free lunch (this has been proven rigorously), and so there is always a penalty to be paid in any solution strategy. For the Kohn-Sham equations, one uses the `effective potential' that is local in space, but has a nonlocal dependence on the density, allowing only an approximate description. Another penalty arises from using the determinantal wave function in the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations does not give a robust approximation to the true ground-state wave function. The last penalty arises because of the ""universal"" nature of density functional: it has the same form for all physical systems and so does not bring out the physical properties that are unique to a particular one. In addition to these issues, readers who insist on constructive approaches to mathematical proof will reject the proof of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, since it relies on proof by contradiction. In physical applications this is a minor issue of course, but in attempts to put density functional theory, indeed all of quantum field theory, on a constructive rigorous mathematical foundation, this issue is of importance. The authors (correctly) have no intention of respecting mathematical rigor, and state so explicitly. Instead they emphasize the physics behind the formalism and discuss the experimental evidence for it. Indeed, the book is full of examples of this evidence, and the appropriate references are given. Most of the discussion on the experimental situation is given in the context of the quantum Hall effect, which seems appropriate given that the authors have made original contributions to the understanding of this effect.[DISCLOSURE: This reviewer knows the second author personally, but did not discuss this review with him.

Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow were my all-time favourite books.But while Ender's Game was spectacular, Ender's Shadow great, and Shadow of the Hegemon good, I thought Shadow puppets was way below my expectations.Everything felt tired, boring, and predictable. As with the later books in the Ender series, It seemed as though there wasn't enough plot to stretch across the pages.Bean and Petra's characters seemed to change radically from Shadow of the Hegemon and Ender's Shadow with no explanation. I also was disapointed in the dialogue. People said things rather abruptly and for no reason. Bean and Petra's romance also seemed very awkward with no excitement at all.And where was Achilles? His great chapters with Petra made me forgive some of Shadow of the Hegemon's boring parts.But as a loyal fan, I still give it 3 stars because it kinda satisfied my longing for another Ender book.

HOMEPLACE,"Lanie took out her journal and dated it April 12, 1928. She started the habit of writing down everything that happened to her when she was no more than eight years old, and now she had six journals completely full. She thought about the prize at school, almost prayed to win, but somehow she could not. “God,” she finally said, “I’ll do my best, and if you’ll help me, that’s all I ask.” Fourteen-year-old Lanie Belle Freeman of Fairhope, Arkansas, has high hopes for her future. Happy on the five-acre family homeplace, she dreams of going to college and becoming a writer. And with her father launching a new business and her mother expecting the fifth baby, the bright days of an early Southern spring seem to herald expansive new beginnings for the Freeman family. But her mother isn’t as strong as she should be, and it’s going to take time for the business to pay back the mortgage. When unexpected tragedy strikes, it is left to Lanie to keep the family together and hold on to their home. In a world shaken by the Great Depression, it is faith in God and love in a tightly knit family that will help Lanie and her siblings overcome the odds and create a future that promises the fulfillment of love. The Homeplace offers a warmhearted and inspiring saga of a courageous young woman who holds her family together through the Depression era.",['Gilbert Morris'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mOFt5oOh0UUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mOFt5oOh0UUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=HOMEPLACE&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Zondervan,2009-05-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mOFt5oOh0UUC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],15.0,B000OVQDXI,,A156KL9V6UG9GY,Donna S Johnson,0/0,5.0,1361664000,Homeplace,"Compelling, a real page turner, once I dove in to this book, I couldn't do another thing, til I read it all"

It seemed to contain the most words, I bought the 2011 but its useless compared to the 1997 which I still use everyday. Try to get a used copy of the 1997 if you still can."

The central character is an American from Montana who speaks fluent Spanish and is known as the ""dynamiter"". He sides with the republicans, as did other Americans such as the Lincoln Brigade and many other westerners and soviets pitted against the Fascists supported by the Nazis and Italians. The American, referred to as Roberto or Ingles by the guerilla band, joins the band behind enemy lines with the expressed purpose of blowing up a bridge to coincide with a republican offensive. The brutality of war is evident by Maria, with the band, who was brutalized and raped while her parents were shot just because they were republicans. In contrast, demonstrating that war is brutal on both sides, Pablo, the band's soddened leader, is traumatized with guilt and feelings of defeat that haunt him with own past butchering of townsmen that were friendly to the Fascists. There is a general feeling of despair as the band attempts to regenerate itself to action in the face of an enemy well supported by aircraft and weaponry. Another key character is Pablo's lady friend Pilar who, once associated with a famous bull fighter, speaks often of manliness and she takes over the leadership temporarily vacated by Pablo's morose fall into a drunken stupor. The discussion of Spanish views of manhood provide an opportunity for Hemingway to expose his fascination with bull fighting and machismo that is both courageous and revolting. Time is fleeting, although the paperback is almost 470 pages, within in the book as an accelerated romance develops between Roberto and Marie that heightens an expectation of loss as the two fall deeply in love. Hemingway consumes the bulk of the book with dialogue within the personalities in the band such as the gypsy and the old man who seems the most dependable and balanced member. Action picks up toward the end of the book as Pablo's band prepares to take action while the Fascists search the mountains for Pablo's associate and his band on a neighboring mountain. As Roberto and Pablo's band seek to destroy the bridge, the republican attack formes in the distance. There is an expectation of great loss and the book climaxes with the attack on the bridge and you feel an uncertainness of doom for the central characters as the end is abrupt and almost shocking. The book is a classic and very realistic, it may be too long for younger readers but it certainly outlines the tragedies of war and perhaps underlines the horror of Civil War.

But once is enough for me for John Caldigate, although I did enjoy it and do recommend it to Trollope fans. Being born in Australia myself, I was especially interested in the parts about gold mining there, and a friend of mine who is intrigued by gold mining and panning loved reading a description of that. Near the end I was obsessed with discovering how the trial came out and couldn't put the book (or, rather, my Kindle) down. The British justice system was thoroughly dealt with and was interesting. The chilling and eerily realistic portrait of Hester Bolton's mother, a puritanical religious fanatic, was fascinating to me. But it wouldn't be fun to read again about her!"

Northanger abbey: A novel,"Austen's witty exploration of the perils of mistaking fiction for reality During an eventful season at Bath, young, naïve Catherine Morland experiences the joys of fashionable society for the first time. She is delighted with her new acquaintances: flirtatious Isabella, who shares Catherine's love of Gothic romance and horror, and sophisticated Henry and Eleanor Tilney, who invite her to their father's mysterious house, Northanger Abbey. There, her imagination influenced by novels of sensation and intrigue, Catherine imagines terrible crimes committed by General Tilney. With its broad comedy and irrepressible heroine, this is the most youthful and and optimistic of Jane Austen's works.

Sorel ""book lovah""",0/1,3.0,1274313600,Classic but still contemporary,"As with most of Austen's books, the plot is simple because the drama is within the people and their relationships. Catherine Morland is a sheltered girl who lived with her family in the country and never had nay friends or suitors. When a friend of her parents decides to take Catherine to live in the city, her whole life changes. She immediately befriends Isabella Thorpe, a deceitful and self-centered girl. Isabella's brother, John, attempts to court Catherine but she remains unswayed for her interests lay with Henry Tilney. As the story continues, Isabella becomes more demanding and almost tries to force Catherine to be with John. Eventually, Catherine finds her voice and refuses John's advancements. Yet, it takes Catherine almost the entire novel to completely come into her own. The title comes from the abbey that Henry Tilney's family owns. Catherine, who spent the majority of her youth reading Gothic novels, is completely enthralled with the abbey so when she is finally invited she just about bursts at the thought of hidden chambers and locked away skeletons. However, what she finds it nothing like what she had planned and when her imagination runs away with itself her relationship with Henry is put at risk.I really enjoyed this novel much more than I thought I would. I found other works by Austen to be boring, dated, and bombastic. Yet, Northanger Abbey is charming and has a message that still rings true today: don't allow yourself to be naive or prone to deceit because people will take advantage of you. In addition, I liked that the romance in the novel took a backseat to Catherine's development. Though it felt sluggish at times, I was never disinterested. I also loved Austen's defense of novels and the Gothic elements in this book."

However, the appeal comes at the end of the book when you realize how innocence is destroyed by evil. My take on this novel: These boys wanted to build a society, ""make it English"". However, the innocence of adolescence doesn't prepare them for becoming a man, no matter how much they think so. I think in the end, the idea of being hunters and having ""fun"" overcomes the idea of rules and a society. However, you can clearly see how this affects the boy's and turns them into savages, who roam and kill. This book is definitely appealing for young boys. Girls, not as much."

In the novel, the descriptions were too monotonous and I did not notice that i was skipping vital parts of the book that were hidden between tedious plant matter...But once I started re-reading certain parts of the book, I've realized why the book won that prestigious whatever-its-called prize. It really did tell of the horrors of humankind that outweigh the good, and it's symbols were powerful, especially the lord of the flies character.The character I admire the most has to be Simon. Then maybe Piggy or Ralph. But Simon is a symbol of the good of human nature. Simon helps the ""lilluns"" reach the fruit, he gives Piggy his meat, and admires nature in his special spot in the island. He represents human instinct, but not the bad kind, not the one of selfishness and savage, but of goodness and kindness to everything as a whole. The sad part is that there aren't many people like Simon, and in the end, he is taken over by the evil, the ""darkness"", the ""beast"" that exists in the savage kids, and essentially in everyone. And sadly, before he could tell everyone his discoveries.What i find quite strange is that in the end, the savage tribe is saved by their own device. That's funny, and it didn't really seem fitting to the book's nature. But it worked to it's advantage, as it signify's the loss of innocence in the boys.When people say that this book is unrealistic, I ask them, ""Well have you ever got stuck in an unknown Island with a bunch of kids you don't know for a couple of months?""The children in the island represent society. Using children as a symbol only makes the effect of the novel stronger. A society that would rather listen to their instincts than reason (Piggy), the book plainly displays the darkness and evils of mankind in a nightmarish and cruel way, and perhaps that's why some people refuse to accept the main ideas of the book."

Golding uses the circumstance of teenage boys marooned on a tropical island by a plane crash to illustrate in exciting detail how some react to conflict and adversity. The flawed &quot;society&quot; the boys develop in their quest for survival is a microcosm of our modern civilized world. Lessons and questions abound in his masterful prose--without preaching or pretense.This book is much more than just a story; it is art. It's one those pieces of literature that add to culture and foment introspection in young readers. In a small way, the world is a better place because of Lord of the Flies. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."

The Psychology of Love,,,,,,,,,,0300045891,,A3RFXU3P0XKKF4,"Herbert L Calhoun ""paulocal""",1/1,4.0,1299024000,A Sophisticated treatment of a Familiar Topic,"Given that psychology itself would seem incomplete if serious psychologists did not prove that they at least understood this most basic engine of human emotions, interactions and activity, these 16 authors seem to have taken up this state of incompleteness as a professional challenge for themselves.After having perused more than a dozen self-help and pop psychology books on the topic myself, this book is one of the first (and still few) serious studies of the topic of love, per se. Almost 25 years old now, we find here lots of new insights and more than just a few surprises. For instance, it attempts to grapple with the definition of love: Is it an attitude, an emotion, a set of behaviors? Is it an individual orientation or a dyadic bond? How does it differ from infatuation or just pure sexual attraction, or mere lush? How is it best categorized as a psychological phenomenon? What are its connection to evolution and biology? What is its anatomy? How do we maintain it? And perhaps most important of all, how do we properly engage in it passionately? In short, much to my surprise, this edited volume attempts to answer these and other questions; and in the process of doing so, exposes a whole new world and study of the psychology of, and theories about love, theories of which, as it turns out, are an altogether quite robust field of psychological enquiry in itself.Before this, the book by Ayn Rand's boyfriend, Nathaniel Braden called ""The Psychology of Romantic Love,"" and Eric Fromm's seminal, ""The Art of Loving,"" had been my favorite guides to the topic. As none of the contributors cited either of these two authors (although Fromm's was mentioned, in passing, in the introduction), one must assume that the theories and topics covered in those two books do not exactly overlap with the deeper psychological treatment provided here. The appeal here is much more serious and focussed much more on the theoretical ""whys"" of love: Their origins, the practices of love across cultures and across time; its taboos as well as what are considered its abnormal practices The biography is academic as opposed to being just pop psychology.In short, they have provided us with the missing link in psychology: the psychology of love. And in this task, it must be said that they have done more than just an admirable job. Four Stars"

Mischief,"The riveting true story of decadence, deception, and murder among British aristocrats in colonial Kenya In 1941, with London burning in the Blitz, a group of hedonistic English nobles partied shamelessly in Kenya. Far removed from falling bombs, the wealthy elites of “Happy Valley” indulged in morphine, alcohol, and unrestricted sex, often with their friends’ spouses. But the party turned sinister in the early hours of a January morning for Josslyn Hay, Lord Erroll, who had been enjoying the favors of the beautiful young wife of a middle-aged neighbor. Hay was found dead, a bullet in his brain. The murder shocked the close-knit community of wealthy expatriates in Nairobi and shined a harsh light on their louche lifestyle. Three decades later, author James Fox researched the slaying of Lord Erroll, an unsolved crime still sheathed in a thick cloud of rumor and innuendo. What he discovered was both unsettling and luridly compelling. White Mischief is a spellbinding true-crime classic, a tale of privileged excess and the wages of sin, and an account of one writer’s determined effort to crack a cold and craven killing.",['James Fox'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3cdcAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3cdcAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mischief&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2014-05-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3cdcAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['True Crime'],5.0,B000JGH1PM,,AYNJEWSG7W9RP,LadyM,0/0,3.0,1335916800,Unmemorable,I gave it 3 stars because it truly was unmemorable.

Stone,3/6,4.0,1156809600,A Milquetoast Utopia,"Of all the pictures fun to imagine for the student of socialisms and utopias, American and otherwise, is to visualize a young Aldous Huxley or George Orwell sitting down near their respective public school fire places, during a cold and clammy English afternoon, and reading Looking Backwards. It is very easy for the reader to see Huxley and Orwell, if they did in fact read Bellamy's rather quaint vision of utopia, reflecting to them selves as they wrote their dystopic masterpieces, A Brave New World and 1984, respectively, ""Alright. But what if...?""Just like Huxley's and Orwell's works, Edward Bellamy is reacting to the horrors of his age. Violent confrontations between labor and capital in every corner of the United States were all the rage, and strikes before the age of enforced collective bargaining or binding arbitration were no joke. Imperialist wars in every corner of the world were threatening a world wide war--seemingly every other year. There were rumblings of an international socialist movement that was yearly gaining strength in Europe in spite of serious legal restrictions--while Bellamy was in University in Germany, he would have had a difficult time avoiding knowledge of the imprisonment of SPD leaders August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht as well as the banning of the Party by von Bismarck's government. What most likely struck the most horror into Bellamy, though, was the absolute wretchedness of the slums that so many Americans were trying to survive in, and the inability of anyone to even try to create a way out of it that can not in some way be traced back to self-interest, greed or outright violence.Looking Backward is an attempt to imagine a world where poverty and ignorance are abolished in the sentimental tradition of Charles Dickens--hero of Bellamy and the novel's protagonist Julian West--coupled with a truly novel bureaucratic technocracy. It was at least in part the influence of Bellamy's idealism that Leon Trotsky found most loathsome in American socialism, whether he knew it or not, when he unforgettably called the New York Socialist Party leader, Morris Hillquit ""the ideal Socialist leader for successful dentists."" Marx would likely have written off Bellamy using the language that Julian West uses to describe the Mesmerist, Dr. Pillsbury, who puts him into a one hundred thirteen year catatonic--a mere quack. What both Trotsky and Marx would have grudgingly realized on reading this book is that Bellamy was one of the few people in America in 1887--aside from a handful of socialists, anarchists, and union-syndicalists--who was openly hoping for a day when human beings would leave the realm of necessity and enter the realm of freedom.The world which Julian West enters at the close of the twentieth century, when entreated by Dr. Leete to rouse him self, is a radically altered one. As Rip Van Winkle woke up in the Catskills to find that he no longer owed his allegiance to a King and at first finds that this is a truly bewildering situation, West finds a world even more bewildering to a Boston Brahmin. Complete and total state ownership of all means of production had been achieved during his long sleep, but even more shocking was that the United States was no longer a country suffering from any social ills. Cooperation reigned in the place of the pecuniary interests of individuals. The mentality of dog eat dog, which bred both ridiculous ostentation and indefensible poverty, had simply vanished leaving in its place a world of light labor, high culture, and nearly universal contentment. The state is run by disinterested pensioners--yes, Bellamy believes such a political animal would exist--in such a way as to ensure that the profit motive does not exist, and all that men, and women, truly compete for is glory. All work to the benefit of this cooperative commonwealth to the best of their ability and equality in the most literal terms. This is not Julian West's Boston.What becomes apparent to the reader traveling with Julian in this new world is that in many ways Julian has not left the close of the nineteenth century. Boston at the close of the twentieth century, in spite of the technological revolutions and complete reordering of the state and economy, is very much the same for Julian West. He enjoys the highest of high culture through the intricate wall card telephone system of his acoustically treated room; drinks fine wine and smokes great cigars; at communal kitchens all eat cuisine that only the leisured rich could have afforded a century before. The blessings of civilization are enjoyed by all alike to the point that where, affectively, all have become members of a universally leisured single class. The impoverished and the working classes of America, seemingly, had nothing to lose but their poverty, ignorance, and despair. The truly leisured class had, seemingly, only their haughtiness and arrogance to lose. This is where some of my troubles with Edward Bellamy begin, and where some of his own prejudices become apparent.Bellamy identifies the world in his Boston as having been broken down into truly distinct peoples. As he puts it at the opening of his work, America was organized upon ""the immemorial division of society into the four classes, or nations, as they may be more fitly called, since the differences between them were far greater than those between any nations nowadays, of the rich and the poor, the educated and the ignorant."" The ignorance and poverty that so horrified Bellamy was not the only thing about the poor that seems to have been truly their own seems to have died with them.In a truly disturbing way, any notion of how Boston, and America, changed between 1850 and 1887, escapes Bellamy's consciousness. The ""labor question"" has been solved through nationalization and making all people work, in one capacity or other, if they want to have anything other than bread, water and a prison cell. What have happened to the Babel of ethnics, the massive networks of parochial organizations, ethnic clubs and sport organizations that were the wellsprings of life for so many Irish and Irish Americans? There is no evidence in the improved Boston of the late twentieth century of anything other type of respectability than Bourgeoisie Protestant respectability. The people of this appallingly genteel world may very have only the variety of one of their singular stores, which have absolutely no variety in products. The twenty-first century reader is left with the truly weird possibility that Julian West and Dr. Leete, after having exhausted the topic of how much better the present is than the past, will have nothing left to talk about but yachting and literature--what with conflict being abolished.The transplanting of Victorian notions of how the world should be run is nowhere more apparent, and more disturbing for its implications, than when West and Leete speak about what portions of the world are organized on the system that America is organized upon. As Dr. Leete explains to West how international relations work in this era, he states:""[T]he great nations of Europe as well as Australia, Mexico and parts of South America, are now organized industrially like the United States, which was the pioneer of the evolution. The peaceful relations of these nations are assured by a loose form of federal union of world-wide extent. An international council regulates the mutual intercourse commerce of the members of the union and their joint policy toward the more backward races, which are gradually being educated up to civilized institutions.""The white man's burden and civilizing mission does not go the way of the self-interest in idyllic Boston of the future, and an idealist as deeply committed to social justice as Bellamy could not conceive, even in fiction, of any group outside of the boundaries of western society having achieved the level of sophistication that they could live in a classless society. One has to wonder what the old Confederate states would finally have looked like, and whether old rebels and unionists shook hands across a bloody chasm while educating American blacks up to civilization. Whatever, Bellamy thinks about race in America, and how West would have thought about it--the only black we see in this book is the faithful body servant of West in the nineteenth century, one Sawyer, and nothing of consequence comes out of his mouth--we can easily surmise that his utopia was close to being for whites only.Though Bellamy's idealism reads as totally genuine, Looking Backward has some very vital imagination lacking in it. Bellamy has his cooperative commonwealth based upon the principle that all work which serves the common good is equally important, but Bellamy finds it necessary to have West paling around with Leete, a retired physician. In a world where leisure and not labor is the rule, and where the masses are washed and wholly civilized by the exacting standards of an upper class education lasting until at least the twenty-first year, why was it necessary to have Leete be a someone that would be a portrait bourgeoisie respectability? The laboring intellectual, of astute and subtle brilliance with the gnarled hands of a quarter century of hard labor, is the glorious possibility of this world which Bellamy creates for the reader but never actually realizes. Though slightly saddening, this fact probably made the book more readable to the members of America's upper class, and possibly even more plausible to them.From the vantage of the twenty-first century, Bellamy has an ability to appear hopelessly ridiculous. He could not have known how collectivism would lead to mass murder on a colossal scale in Europe and Asia in the Twentieth century--though he would not have been surprised how much of it was done by men and women who looked on the red flag as their own. Nor could he have foreseen how the ""backwards races"" of the world would struggle for their own freedom in the second half the twentieth century, and have several become great powers in their own right by its close. Radio, motion pictures, television, digitized recording devices, the internet, air travel and the hydrogen bomb attached to an intercontinental ballistic missile probably never entered his imagination. He should not, though, be faulted for this. His future was one infinitely brighter than the one the world suffered through, as the nations of the world gorged themselves on the most murderous wars and massacres in mankind's history. For all the novels faults and short comings, it is a profound piece of republican idealism, premised on the very American belief that people coming together can actually change lives."
The Silent War: The Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea,"The Cold War was the first major conflict between superpowers in which victory and defeat were unambiguously determined without the firing of a shot. Without the shield of a strong, silent deterrent or the intellectual sword of espionage beneath the sea, that war could not have been won. John P. Craven was a key figure in the Cold War beneath the sea. As chief scientist of the Navy's Special Projects Office, which supervised the Polaris missile system, then later as head of the Deep Submergence Systems Project (DSSP) and the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle program (DSRV), both of which engaged in a variety of clandestine undersea projects, he was intimately involved with planning and executing America's submarine-based nuclear deterrence and submarine-based espionage activities during the height of the Cold War. Craven was considered so important by the Soviets that they assigned a full-time KGB agent to spy on him. Some of Craven's highly classified activities have been mentioned in such books as Blind Man's Bluff, but now he gives us his own insights into the deadly cat-and-mouse game that U.S. and Soviet forces played deep in the world's oceans. Craven tells riveting stories about the most treacherous years of the Cold War. In 1956 Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine and the backbone of the Polaris ballistic missile system, was only days or even hours from sinking due to structural damage of unknown origin. Craven led a team of experts to diagnose the structural flaw that could have sent the sub to the bottom of the ocean, taking the Navy's missile program with it. Craven offers insight into the rivalry between the advocates of deterrence (with whom he sided) and those military men and scientists, such as Edward Teller, who believed that the United States had to prepare to fight and win a nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. He describes the argument that raged in the Navy over the reasons for the tragic loss of the submarine Thresher, and tells the astonishing story of the hunt for the rogue Soviet sub that became the model for The Hunt for Red October -- including the amazing discovery the Navy made when it eventually found the sunken sub. Craven takes readers inside the highly secret DSSP and DSRV programs, both of which offered crucial cover for sophisticated intelligence operations. Both programs performed important salvage operations in addition to their secret espionage activities, notably the recovery of a nuclear bomb off Palomares, Spain. He describes how the Navy's success at deep-sea recovery operations led to the takeover of the entire program by the CIA during the Nixon administration. A compelling tale of intrigue, both within our own government and between the U.S. and Soviet navies, The Silent War is an enthralling insider's account of how the submarine service kept the peace during the dangerous days of the Cold War.",['John Pina Craven'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ih8MVZlibxYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Ih8MVZlibxYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Silent+War:+The+Cold+War+Battle+Beneath+the+Sea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2002-06-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ih8MVZlibxYC&source=gbs_api,['History'],,0684872137,,,,3/3,4.0,999993600,great book,"To add to what has been said.... I personally don't buy the &quot;Red September&quot; scenario Craven advances. All the evidence points to a far more mundane story- the sub went to a fixed rendezvous point, its emergency call was not picked up by Vladivostok, and when the crew tried to do something about the leaking rocket fuel that led to their emergency situation in the first place- they caused an explosion almost immediately. Why Craven would toy with a propagandistic interpretation is only clear in context of Nixon's bargaining with the Soviets.The explanation of Craven's take on MAD is difficult for me to understand, but I think it's subtle and correct. He does outline the exact reason no 'NMD' system was considered useful in the '60s and the arguments still hold today. Ted Postol is only the latest person to use them and the data obtained properly.I'd like to know more about the hydrophone arrays the USN deployed and the story of the NR-1 (and sister) submarines. Too bad that will not be forthcoming anytime soon. Craven is obviously an extremely capable man, tackling lots of difficult projects with pretty good success and political acumen. Maybe he'll tell us more sometime in the future."

The Secrets of Dr. Taverner,"Dr Taverner is an occult Sherlock Holmes, an esoteric Master who uses his powers to aid 'untreatable' patients for whom orthodox medical science can do nothing. Utilizing his knowledge of White Magic, he fights an unrelenting battle against vampires, death-hounds, body-snatchers and members of the nefarious Black Lodge. Well-written and briskly paced, these twelve stories stand on their own merits - but there is more to these tales than meets the eye. Dion Fortune was herself a mage, a high initiate of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and founder of the Society of the Inner Light. The tales she tells are based on real events, and she uses 'The Secrets of Dr Taverner' as a vehicle to introduce the reader to magical practices and many arcane principles of occult law. Each story in this collection is a complete case, as gripping and as entertaining as the stories of Sherlock Holmes.

Dr. Taverner, assisted by the young Dr. Rhodes, runs a nursing home in which patients suffer from a variety of ""psychological"" disturbances which are all psychic in nature. Very much a Sherlock Holmes bent, as Dr. Taverner, being an adept of an occult order, is able to hone in and cure these various problems using unconventional means.I found the stories to be interesting reading in and of themselves, but according to Dion Fortune, they were all based on actual events that she witnessed in her early occult training. Supposedly, ""Dr. Taverner"" is based on one of her mentors, while ""Dr. Rhodes"" is based on herself. So, read with this in mind, it is doubly fascinating.I also enjoyed the stories from the context of being written not terribly long after World War I, and many references are made to that event, with one story in particular, ""Blood-Lust"" telling of events occurring as a result of the war. In her book,""Psychic Self Defense,"" Fortune goes into more detail about this particular event, which indeed was toned down somewhat for the book.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for an intro to Dion Fortune's fiction."
"The analects of Confucius,","This carefully crafted ebook: “Classic The Analects (The Revised James Legge Translation)” is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. This book is the revised James Legge translation which has been extensively reworked and restored compared to the freely available Legge translations. The Analects, also known as the Analects of Confucius, is the collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius' followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC–221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the Analects was considered merely a ""commentary"" on the Five Classics, but the status of the Analects grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. During the late Song dynasty (960-1279) the importance of the Analects as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the ""Four Books"". The Analects has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. Confucius (551–479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.",['Confucius'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+analects+of+Confucius,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",e-artnow,2013-09-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,B000861BL8,,A2UN4S3N7VYLEV,Charles E. Stevens,15/16,4.0,967075200,"I'm not a Confucius nor a China expert, but ...","I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Granted, I haven't read other translations of the Analects, so my rating is for the book itself more than as a comparison to other translations.The fact that Confucius lived thousands of years ago is amazing to me ... the things he says apply to people throughout the ages, and they're full of wisdom. Having read the book, I find myself trying to be a bit more of a Confucian gentleman than I did before reading it. Confucius' teachings about humanity and being a gentleman span across the ages.I'm very glad I read this book. The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because I can't compare it to other translations, and it seems a little improper to rate a translated book without comparing it to other translations. But I personally found Leys' lines to be easily understandable and interesting, even if I have no way of ascertaining their accuracy with the original text.**7/31/09 UPDATE** I was looking to buy a copy of the Analects for a friend when I came across my own review when trying to decide between versions ... which is a somewhat strange feeling! I'm still not an ""expert"", but having read several more Chinese classics in the meantime, including a few versions of the Analects, I thought I would update this review. I think the Leys translation is a very good introduction to the Analects for someone who is looking for a starting point in Confucian thought. The translation is a little bit loose but flows well in English, the introduction gives a good amount of context without going overboard, and the notes are nicely situated at the end to prevent clutter. This makes it a good version for the Confucius novice, a comment I mean in earnest and not a backhanded compliment. That said, I have yet to find a translation that surpasses Waley's in its rigor and thoroughness; the copious notes and detailed introduction are excellent as well. However, Waley is likely to be a little more difficult for the newcomer to Confucius and Confucianism ... so he might not be the best starting point. As always, different translations work best for different people. Read the first couple of pages of a few versions and you'll quickly have an idea of what suits you. No matter which version you end up with, the Analects is a wonderful work, worthy of the praise it receives!"
Nine Stories,"The ""original, first-rate, serious, and beautiful"" short fiction (New York Times Book Review) that introduced J. D.

From a WWII soldier, a veteran on a vacation, a child prodigy, two young suburban matrons, a law student taking care of a bunch of young boys after school--what is going on in these characters' heads is far more real to them than the world around them. Salinger offers a fairly bleak view of life, but a vivid one.Perhaps my favorite is &quot;For Esme--with love and squalor.&quot; We meet an American soldier based in England, about to go off on a secret mission, which turns out to be D-day. He is part of a company who do not speak with each other--we can clearly see the long grey days of waiting as each man pens letters home but fails to reach out to the guy sitting next to him. A young girl in a tea shop breaks through this isolation briefly but then the soldier leaves; the young girl returns in a surprising way several weeks later and again breaks through a much more profound barrier.

Childrens' authors can't get away with as much as adult authors can; for one thing, they generally have less room in which to get away with it (unless they are J. K.

It's your basic ""be yourself"" kind of book, and reminds me in many ways of Randall Jarrell's brilliant The Bat-Poet. It's shorter, of course, being for a younger audience, and the points that are made are closer to the surface, but Laden still keeps things in hand by letting the story tell the story and giving visual cues that will make the reader of the intended age work (for example, Roberto's dream and its realization, which bookend the narrative in pictures instead of words).

I think the basic idea of the theme is something that interests us all, regarding our former very public figures. However, the more I read, the more I read the same thing, over, and over, and over. There were inconsistencies in Mrs. Reagan's accountings that were not really important, but I think her editor could have guided her in her construction such that we weren't reading in every other sentence how Ronnie hated being away and how I (Nancy) hated not having him in sight. Other than reading the letters themselves, which were very touching and entertaining with the homespun humor that was so typical of the man, I think we learned all that we were going to learn about this couple in the first ten pages of the book. I have nothing against Mrs. Reagan; she is obviously the devoted and loving spouse that we would all aspire to be, or to have. But this book should have been much less repetitive in its ongoing theme. The sweetness becomes syruppy and then sickly sweet as it is continually poured out by the bucketful."
"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","In a work of extraordinary narrative power, filled with brilliant personalities and vivid scenes of dramatic action, Robert K. Massie, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Peter the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Dreadnought, elevates to its proper historical importance the role of sea power in the winning of the Great War. The predominant image of this first world war is of mud and trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, poison gas, and slaughter. A generation of European manhood was massacred, and a wound was inflicted on European civilization that required the remainder of the twentieth century to heal. But with all its sacrifice, trench warfare did not win the war for one side or lose it for the other. Over the course of four years, the lines on the Western Front moved scarcely at all; attempts to break through led only to the lengthening of the already unbearably long casualty lists. For the true story of military upheaval, we must look to the sea. On the eve of the war in August 1914, Great Britain and Germany possessed the two greatest navies the world had ever seen. When war came, these two fleets of dreadnoughts—gigantic floating castles of steel able to hurl massive shells at an enemy miles away—were ready to test their terrible power against each other. Their struggles took place in the North Sea and the Pacific, at the Falkland Islands and the Dardanelles. They reached their climax when Germany, suffocated by an implacable naval blockade, decided to strike against the British ring of steel. The result was Jutland, a titanic clash of fifty-eight dreadnoughts, each the home of a thousand men. When the German High Seas Fleet retreated, the kaiser unleashed unrestricted U-boat warfare, which, in its indiscriminate violence, brought a reluctant America into the war. In this way, the German effort to “seize the trident” by defeating the British navy led to the fall of the German empire. Ultimately, the distinguishing feature of Castles of Steel is the author himself. The knowledge, understanding, and literary power Massie brings to this story are unparalleled.

The hunt for the Goeben in the early days of the war made the British look like cowards. But the days of Nelson were over, and a captain could now do wrong by putting his ship up against the enemy. Quite simply, a large enemy ship could sink a squadron of cruisers before they ever came within firing range.Jellicoe, as commander of the high seas fleet, realised that he was the only man alive who could lose the war for Great Britain in a single day. He entered the war without a secure base for his fleet, which quickly came under attack from submarines and mines.Captains were no longer in sole command of affairs at sea. The invention of the radio allowed shore based admirals and the First Lord himself to barrage captains at sea with suggestions and orders, which complicated reporting lines, and confused the situation for captains.Massie traces the resultant developments in strategy from these salient points, leading to the climactic Battle of Jutland, and the effective end of the surface war at sea.A brilliant piece of work, and a fantastic piece of naval history writing. While the book is large, it is surprisingly easy to digest, and makes for easy reading."
"Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea","In a work of extraordinary narrative power, filled with brilliant personalities and vivid scenes of dramatic action, Robert K. Massie, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Peter the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Dreadnought, elevates to its proper historical importance the role of sea power in the winning of the Great War. The predominant image of this first world war is of mud and trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, poison gas, and slaughter. A generation of European manhood was massacred, and a wound was inflicted on European civilization that required the remainder of the twentieth century to heal. But with all its sacrifice, trench warfare did not win the war for one side or lose it for the other. Over the course of four years, the lines on the Western Front moved scarcely at all; attempts to break through led only to the lengthening of the already unbearably long casualty lists. For the true story of military upheaval, we must look to the sea. On the eve of the war in August 1914, Great Britain and Germany possessed the two greatest navies the world had ever seen. When war came, these two fleets of dreadnoughts—gigantic floating castles of steel able to hurl massive shells at an enemy miles away—were ready to test their terrible power against each other. Their struggles took place in the North Sea and the Pacific, at the Falkland Islands and the Dardanelles. They reached their climax when Germany, suffocated by an implacable naval blockade, decided to strike against the British ring of steel. The result was Jutland, a titanic clash of fifty-eight dreadnoughts, each the home of a thousand men. When the German High Seas Fleet retreated, the kaiser unleashed unrestricted U-boat warfare, which, in its indiscriminate violence, brought a reluctant America into the war. In this way, the German effort to “seize the trident” by defeating the British navy led to the fall of the German empire. Ultimately, the distinguishing feature of Castles of Steel is the author himself. The knowledge, understanding, and literary power Massie brings to this story are unparalleled. His portrayals of Winston Churchill, the British admirals Fisher, Jellicoe, and Beatty, and the Germans Scheer, Hipper, and Tirpitz are stunning in their veracity and artistry. Castles of Steel is about war at sea, leadership and command, courage, genius, and folly. All these elements are given magnificent scope by Robert K. Massie’ s special and widely hailed literary mastery. BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Robert K. Massie's Catherine the Great.",['Robert K.

It was one of those books that I hated finishing. Every chapter brimmed with wonderful anecdotes and stellar writing. I put ""Dreadnought"" right up there with Barbara Tuchman's ""The Guns of August"" as one of the classic accounts of the Great War.At 780 pages, ""Castles of Steel"" requires an act of faith to pick up the book and begin reading. Fortunately, Massie delivers a well written account of the naval war between Great Britain and Germany. All of the major sea battles of the war are examined with careful but not pedantic detail. Fortunately, as a work of popular history, Massie does not need to bog down his story with the obscure details an academic history would have to include. There will probably never be a better written popular account of the Great War at Sea.Unfortunately, Robert Massie has to crowd in an awful lot of history into his 780 pages. What gets lost in his account is the well told anecdote and the rich background detail that made ""Dreadnought"" such a pleasure to read. There is just enough background writing to make one miss reading ""Dreadnought"". ""Castles of Steel"" would have had to push on a thousand pages to fill it with the same level of detail. To give but one example, Massie never informs his reader about simple details such as what is the difference between a light cruiser, a fast cruiser and a battle cruiser. The maps and pictures also do not do justice to the story being told.All in all this is a very good acccount of naval warfare during the Great War. I will probably never have to read another book on this subject. However, ""Castles of Steel"" does not rise to the level of classic like ""Dreadnought"" or ""The Guns of August."" I would be willing to bet that in 40 years, ""Dreadnought"" will still be in print and ""Castles of Steel"" will only be found in libraries."

NOSTROMO (Bantam Classic),"Set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana, this classic story of revolution, deception, and self-betrayal centers on Nostromo, a handsome Italian sailor who, like Costaguana, is being consumed by secret guilt and corruption",['Joseph Conrad'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=unS3iIwdJ1oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=unS3iIwdJ1oC&q=NOSTROMO+(Bantam+Classic)&dq=NOSTROMO+(Bantam+Classic)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam Classics,1989-04,http://books.google.com/books?id=unS3iIwdJ1oC&dq=NOSTROMO+(Bantam+Classic)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],5.0,0553213598,,A67NO0TFRCNK1,Dr Tathata,0/0,5.0,1326412800,Lay Not Up Your Treasure,"Joseph Conrad had a few things in common with 'Our Man', Nostromo, one of the compelling characters of his little morality tale resonating with metaphorical reverberations that just expand in circles to infinity. He became an orphan at a relatively early age, and went to sea at the age of 14. English was like, the 5th language he learned, and yet, his talent as a writer and story teller and poser of complex unanswerable questions places him among the most gifted in the tradition of world literature.Like 12:34 ""For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.""The earliest civilizations may have evolved to brew beer--but it is true that the stability and longevity of a civilization owes itself to the harmony and balance of it's capitalization. Some primate anthropologists once dumped a truckload of bananas in a clearing in the forest, and the social order of the Apes broke down completely. Instead of the ragged system of social checks and balances, the Alpha male climbed up on top of the pile and took possession of the bananas, his close associates then handed out the bananas according to the status of the other members of the social order. Those with the least status were teased and tormented. The Alpha male was particularly generous to the young females he courted. All it took to upset millions of years of complex primate social evolution was a truckload of bananas.Guano, of course, is also a valuable commodity, for fertilizer, it stains many a rocky outcrop white, and of course, Costaguana seems to have an inverted meaning from Costa Rico. However, Rico it may be, because of the silver mine, but no form of lasting social order ever seems to prevail. Trying to find the right balance between the production of silver, attracting foreign investment, and establishing social and economic progress is difficult when you are surrounded by competing brutes who all want the goose that laid the silver eggs for themselves. The present owner of the goose might just blow it all up to kingdom come. And the one man who might be counted upon to prevail in such chaos, comes to realize his own value, his own significance, is not really set as high as he had anticipated by whom he has served both faithfully, and heroically. What is 'treasure', after all? What is the quality of high value? In the end, the love that Nostromo finds seems more valuable than gold, forget the cache of silver. And yet, accidents can happen. All roads lead to the graveyard. Nobody takes it with them. So, what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world, if he loses his soul?Conrad, once again, has found a situation, and a story that asks fundamental questions about the nature of 'value', and competition, and collaboration, and self interest, and what it takes to find balance and harmony among competing forces. He invests fully realized figures with character. His style is unusual, and somewhat fragmented in it's modular structure, yet there are times when he paints long flowing pictures that almost seem to spring to life. There is a certain magic in what he seems to be able to accomplish. He is a spellbinder, an effortless master of the psychology of piquing interest and attaching it to the storyteller's tellingI first read the novel more than 30 years ago, but re-read it recently, and was even more impressed on my second reading, with both his skill and the depth of his story. Conrad has always been one of my favorite authors, and Nostromo is one of his greatest achievements. He was a pioneer of the 'modern' novel, and his interest in verisimilitude, in asking difficult questions trump any hope for happy endings--Conrad has a dark view of human nature, and Nostromo, the novel, is an exercise in showing what it takes to corrupt the treasure of a good human nature. In the case of Nostromo, it was simply not being revered by men for whom he had risked everything. Conrad seems to be continually asking: where CAN you lay up your treasures where dust and moths will not corrupt?"

I love reading, but this book just seemed a bit boring. Well, once I began reading it, my opinion drastically changed. It is so well-written. The characters are so real- granted, some are a bit exaggerated, but that seems to be Austen's point...exaggerating the faults of society. The tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, and the subplots with the other characters draw together a fine novel. I also completely enjoyed the fact that there was not a lot of description in the book; it let you form your own opinion of how the settings and characters looked.

A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots.

When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley.

The subject matter begins with the obvious COM and n-tier architecture, which will ease the beginners in. Afterwards the plot thickens as more advanced areas are covered, like COM+ services, universal data access, XML and SOAP. The book is also great on the practical side as the theory is put to practice in a series of sample applications exploring the architectural ideas and techniques of implementation. This book builds and enhances the ideas first explored in the book ""Professional MTS and MSMQ Programming with VB and ASP"", and in contrast to that book you will find here a more robust, detailed and mature coverage of the subject matter.A must book for visual basic developers working on distributed or web based applications.

Rush ""missouri reb""",2/2,4.0,1298937600,Good Read In Spite Of Flaws,"It had been about four years since I last read Setting The Record Straight, so I pulled it off the shelf for another read. My original impressions were confirmed. This is a very readable and fascinating addition to the Hendrix library, but John McDermott's co-authorship should be enough to give any serious fan of Jimi's pause. Since this book's release, McDermott's become the ""official"" historian for Janie Hendrix's empire and has done less than a credible job at writing liner notes etc. for the various ""authorized"" releases from Experience Hendrix. For example labeling the instrumental demo of Angel as Little Wing on the South Saturn Delta CD. As pointed out by another reviewer, in this book, he continually refers to Voodoo Child (Slight Return) as Voodoo Chile. Even a casual fan of Jimi's music isn't likely to confuse these two very different songs. It begs the question, just how big of fan are you John?On the flip side, however, we have Eddie Kramer as a co-author. Mr. Kramer spent a lot of serious quality time with Hendrix. We're talking literally hundreds of hours in the studio and recorder and engineer of several concerts as well. His input is priceless. There's also dozens of others who knew Hendrix, some in a professional capacity, some as friends, whose memories help to make this volume a must read.The story here starts in 1966 when Jimi was still playing clubs in Greenwich Village. It only briefly covers his earlier life. This book's primary focus is on Hendrix's musical career from that point to his untimely death, and the fate of his musical legacy after. Ther's a lot of detail about his relationships with Chas Chandler and Michael Jeffery, the business deals, concert tours, and of course the recording of those wonderful albums. While this is by no means a definitive account, it is certainly a valuable suppliment to the other books about Jimi's life and music. There's a good discography at the end of the book covering all the official releases up to 1991 (this book came out in '92) as well as all the releases by others that Hendrix either produced or played on.Over all, there's enough substance and good info here for me to recommend this book. Just be warned, McDermott has some serious flaws, and he oddly uses one of Monika Dannemann's (she's given several over the years) accounts of Hendrix's death, the one where he was still alive when he got to the hospital, not the one where he died in the ambulance. Use a little caution, and by all means don't make this the only Hendrix book you read, but go ahead and pick this up. It's dirt cheap here on Amazon at the time of this writing."

This analysis from the early 1970s is obviously outdated because Las Vegas hadn't yet become the monument to megalomania and excess that it is today, but it was already well on its way. The authors analyze Vegas' unique usages of space, lighting, placement, transportation, and building design for the purposes of communication and promotion. Strange chapter titles give a clue to the left-field analysis in store, and the authors have a clear sense of irony, underhandedly implying that Vegas presents the worst in architecture while they appear to be praising its uniqueness. Unfortunately the narrative gets bogged down in dense professor-speak terminology like ""Brazilianoid"" and ""neo-Constructivist megastructures,"" along with a general overload of obtuse theory. Add to that the poor-quality and under-elaborated illustrations and you have a book that sacrifices insight and readability in favor of pedantic attempts to impress the authors' colleagues.

The Wisdom of Insecurity,,,,,,,,,,B000K2CHJA,,A1ZEOVGC3CDE0C,Raymond Mathiesen,0/0,4.0,1196812800,Asian wisdom,"I t is hard to believe but in the first part of his life Alan Watts was an Anglican priest. His first two books,Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical ReligionandThe Supreme Identity, were written in that Christian mode. Watts however went back to college to study Eastern religion and philosophy, and this book is the first fruits of that work.If I were rating just the first half of this book it would get five stars. In these first four chapters Watts gives a brilliant diagnosis of the problem of modern man. Put very briefly we are caught in the eternal 'I', feeling separate from life, and caught up in contemplation of past hurts and future hopes. We never really live our life, which after all is in the here and now. We are driven to escape a sense of ""insecurity"" without realizing that this very uncertainty is a basic feature of life.In the second half of the book Watts tries to describe a new way of living based on 'now consciousness'. His task is I guess impossible as he is trying to describe something which is basically unknowable unless you actually live it. I did really understand his point that if you mind shifts off the 'I' it naturally turns to contemplating others, and this is the basis of compassion. I suspect that this second half of the book will mean more to me when I have experimented a little and reread a few times. This second half of the book has certainly given me something to think about.Don't let my comments in the above paragraph put you off reading the book. Maybe you are brighter or more 'enlightened' than me and so it will all make instant sense to you. Maybe you will become instantly ""enlightened' as you read, where I was not."

Miracle in the Andes [Audio] [Cd] [Unabridged],"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A harrowing, moving memoir of the 1972 plane crash that left its survivors stranded on a glacier in the Andes—and one man’s quest to lead them all home—now in a special edition for 2022, commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the crash, featuring a new introduction by the author “In straightforward, staggeringly honest prose, Nando Parrado tells us what it took—and what it actually felt like—to survive high in the Andes for seventy-two days after having been given up for dead.”—Jon Krakauer, author of Into the Wild “In the first hours there was nothing, no fear or sadness, just a black and perfect silence.” Nando Parrado was unconscious for three days before he woke to discover that the plane carrying his rugby team to Chile had crashed deep in the Andes, killing many of his teammates, his mother, and his sister. Stranded with the few remaining survivors on a lifeless glacier and thinking constantly of his father’s grief, Parrado resolved that he could not simply wait to die. So Parrado, an ordinary young man with no particular disposition for leadership or heroism, led an expedition up the treacherous slopes of a snowcapped mountain and across forty-five miles of frozen wilderness in an attempt to save his friends’ lives as well as his own.

Each chapters are good but most chapters are boring because the family talk too much. That's why nobody likes this book. I think this is one of the best book I ever read because it tells you what does the Great Depression looks like. You feel that you are really in it. What's more this book is not just about the Joad's family but there is lots of information of what the depression looks like.

They grow up together and fight together.My favorite part of the book was the big gang fight towards the end of the story. It started out with Darry taking on anyone who dared to. He ended up fighting someone he already knew. After they began fighting, both groups charged and began fighting. Ponyboy was injured during the fight and ended up missing a lot of school because of it. This was my favorite part of the book because it had tons of action and was a critical part of the story.There are several reasons I love this book and suggest it. Anyone who likes a story about sticking together, action, violence, and getting into a trouble, this book is definitely a book you would enjoy. Also, despite all of the violence, the book stlil has a great message. It talks about the importnace of having good friends and to always protect them and do anything for them, sometimes even driving you to death. This is probably the best book I've ever read and I really hope that you can one day read it and enjoy it just like I have."

He has two brothers, Sodapop who is also know as Soda and Darrel who is also known as Darry. Ponyboy loves Soda more than anyone in his family including his parent who had just recently passed away. In the gang there was also Two-Bit, the oldest of all Greasers, Steve, Dally and Johnny. Johnny, whose parents on't care for him, had just recently been jumped by the Socs, the other gang in town. In this book the Socs get away much easier than the Greasers, for example if there were a rumble in between the two gangs the Greasers would get much more severe punishments.I could relate to Johnny because about two years ago two kids came over to me when I was walking down the block with my friend and started a fight with me and my friend. Like Johnny, I had to protect myself, so I had the same feeling he had when he and Ponyboy were walking in the park and the bunch of Socs jumped them. Although, I didn't get into as much trouble as Johnny was in.I really liked the book, The Outsiders. My favorite part of the book was when Johnny and Ponyboy met Cherry. It showed that even though they were from different gangs they still kept a great relationship and a strong bond. The way they didn't drop there relationship showed me that though they kept it secret it showed that they really had great relationship. I think ten to fifteen year old boys should read this book."

It is a first person book with the main Character Ponyboy narrating it. Ponyboy is a 14 year old kid who is raised by his two older brothers because both his Parents had died. He, his brothers, and his friends are members of the Greasers, a gang consisting of lower to middle class guys who rival the Socs, the more wealthy people. The gangs have several fights so there is no shortage of action in this book.One of the things that makes this book great is the ups and downs that Ponyboy has to go through. A big down moment occurred to when his best friend Johnny severely injured his back in an attempt to rescue others from being harmed. The emotional impact this made on Ponyboy was very well described and the whole situation made you want to read on.Overall, I think this is a very good book, certainly worth taking the time to read. The Characters are all well drawn out with their distinct personalities. Some of the things that prevented me from giving this book a 5 star rating were that the history of the gangs and why they were formed were never described. Also, I have read better books before, but this is a very good book, and I would recommend reading it."

Through a racked chain of events, he meets Marcus (and Marcus's mother). Marcus comes to enjoy Will's company, and when he discovers Will's little secret, he blackmails Will into helping him. Will can teach him how to be cool and tell him important stuff like who Kurt Cobain is. But when Marcus is confronted by his mother about the mysterious trips he takes after school, it looks like the jig is up--for both Marcus and Will.Hornby wrote this book in the third person, and I believe that gave him a little more &quot;room to breathe&quot;. He cane look at situations from more than one point of view and write with a more objective frame of mind. This makes &quot;About A Boy&quot; highly enjoyable and accessible to all audiences."

And he's discovered a brilliant new way of meeting women - through single-parent groups.

They all have their particular weaknesses and are both so totally unperfect that you have to love them. Will never manages to get a relationship going over some time and Marcus is bullied at school but then they meet in a drastic event (Marcus kills a duck, by accidentally hitting it with a hard bread he threw away) and start to like each other and learn from each other.I can only recommend to anyone who likes to read about stories that might be true as they're written, that deal with (almost) everyday topics and are written in such a queer way that you just have to read the book in one go."

Will Freeman's name alone should indicate sufficiently where his character is coming from--he's jazzy, he's today, he's independently wealthy--heck, he's almost archetypal ""men's-magazine cool."" Sub-zero Will may be, but ah, that's about as far as his life's ambition impels, so don't ask him to be godfather to your child. That independent wealth thing, as many of us could stand to risk finding out, cuts both ways. Will's not rich, mind you, it's just that his breezy middle class lifestyle simply doesn't require that he work--he lives off the royalties of a Christmas song his late father wrote. It stands to reason that he cringes at hearing ""Santa's Super Sleigh"" and would just as soon give the holidays a miss.But Will is not the ""boy"" of the title--not really, anyway. The boy is Marcus--twelve-year-old son of an overly sincere, political-vegetarian, Joni Mitchell fan of a depressed single mom that won't let him be a kid. The book is the story of Marcus and Will's friendship and the two are actually dual protagonists--Hornby does a fine job balancing their perspectives with a third person narrator limited in omniscience to the two of them. Marcus is a strange kid who is done no favors by his strange mother. He is also a lonely and tormented pre-teen, but still has the wherewithal to blackmail Will into a friendship. This after he finds out that Will pretended to have a child just to meet single moms. As you can see, theses two don't have your typical Big Brother program relationship.Hornby masterfully--and without seeming to exert himself--conveys the world that both Marcus and Will have to grow up in. His secondary characters aren't as fleshed out as some might desire, but nor are they the stereotypes you might find strolling the sidewalks in any given city. ABOUT A BOY is a sharply written, fun-to-read tale about the inevitability of engaging with life. It doesn't surpass HIGH FIDELITY, but this book sure does live up to it admirably. Give us more, Mr Hornby!"

(P-90) He also tells us, ""education and schooling are...mutually exclusive terms."" (P-91)Gatto's remarkable critique of the American system of schooling, John Gatto uses his thirty years in the system to reveal the underlying abuse of children as the system creates generations of unthinking cogs in the wheels of our society, stifling creativity and individual action. He recalls how his ""Tom Sawyer"" youth along the Monongahela River contributed more to his education than the schooling he received. He reminds us that the commonly given excuses for schools, reading for example, are phony. Literacy rates in the United States were higher before compulsory schooling than at any time since. He lists the real concepts and behaviors taught by the school system; among them are Indifference, Class Position, Dependence, and One Can't Hide. School systems prepare each subsequent generation to be consumers, workers, and mindless cogs in a society of controlled and regulated automatons.In the years since the publication of this eye-opening book, John Gatto has been invited to speak all over the world.

Smart Choices: A Practical Guide to Making Better Decisions,"Become confident in your choices. Where should I live? Is it time to get a new job? Which job candidate should I hire? What business strategy should I pursue? We spend the majority of our lives making decisions, both big and small. Yet, even though our success is largely determined by the choices that we make, very few of us are equipped with useful decision-making skills. Because of this, we often approach our choices tentatively, or even fearfully, and avoid giving them the time and thought required to put our best foot forward. In Smart Choices, John Hammond, Ralph Keeney, and Howard Raiffa—experts with over 100 years of experience resolving complex decision problems—offer a proven, straightforward, and flexible roadmap for making better and more impactful decisions, and offer the tools to achieve your goals in every aspect of your life. Their step-by-step, divide-and conquer approach will teach you how to: • Evaluate your plans • Break your potential decision into its key elements • Identify the key drivers that are most relevant to your goals • Apply systematic thinking • Use the right information to make the smartest choice Smart Choices doesn’t tell you what to decide; it tells you how. As you routinely use the process, you’ll become more confident in your ability to make decisions at work and at home. And, more importantly, by applying its time-tested methods, you’ll make better decisions going forward. Be proactive. Don’t wait until a decision is forced on you—or made for you. Seek out decisions that advance your long-term goals, values, and beliefs. Take charge of your life by making Smart Choices a lifetime habit.","['John S. Hammond', 'Ralph L.

Finnegans Wake,"A daring work of experimental, Modernist genius, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is one of the greatest literary achievements of the twentieth century, and the crowning glory of Joyce's life. The Penguin Modern Classics edition of includes an introduction by Seamus Deane 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs' Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter's mental illness. If you enjoyed Finnegans Wake, you might like Virginia Woolf's The Waves, also available in Penguin Classics. 'An extraordinary performance, a transcription into a miniaturized form of the whole western literary tradition' Seamus Deane",['James Joyce'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7NVxCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=7NVxCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Finnegans+Wake&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin UK,2015-06-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7NVxCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],24.0,B000HJR45I,,A2V79Y19V2OO2O,Travis Hedge Coke,10/12,5.0,1286150400,Wipe Your Own Glosses,"Virtually any prep you are given for Finnegans Wake amounts to this: misdirection. Sometimes, the pretentious will tell you that you need decades of study before even glancing at the first page of text, or times, it's the assertion that a dry gloss of wounded-hand heroes and other Joseph Campbell-style tropes of myth are the required lens; that the sexuality, humor, and apparent spontaneity are all illusory because this is a serious book. Of course, it is a serious book, because sex, jokes, and the moment are all serious things. Serious enough for great consideration and extended rumination, serious enough to include one truly tragic and one genuinely funny moment per page, at a minimum. But, never so serious the ribald excitement, the childish humor, the elegant puns or pretty wrecks should be locked up and kept from everyone.One strain of Finnegans Wake's story is just that, the locking up for fantastic elements of our everyday wonderful existence, ostensibly because we aren't educated enough, serious enough, or blessed enough to have and appreciate nice things like that, and throwing away the key into a fastrunning stream of rhetoric. But the rest of the Wake is set in opposition to that strain, makes a mockery of those empty stabs at repression, those silly trite bouts of selfish self-congratulatory elitism pretending to be knowing concern. Finnegans Wake has little need to obfuscate for any reason but to entice, as a beautiful scene beyond a parting veil or a what-the-butler-saw peep machine. It makes a burlesque of life, and teases away while giving forth just as that, but it is not malicious in its restraint or its flourishes; it wants us to come along!Foremost, Finnegans Wake is fun and wants us to have fun. Anyone tells you different, is lying or misguided. Lilting leaning longing lunging lusting and lasting, the Wake wants us all along. It wants us to keep up. I say it, because it does escape the commands of authors and the demands of readers. The book lives extant, it reacts to us as we react to it, and its self-reflexive nature allow the read of the book, the text(s) and the gloss(es) to grow and change as we grow and change, as the world, its history present and future change.You understand Finnegans Wake. Go in knowing that and let no one convince you otherwise. What you understand, reading it, may not be what someone else understands, but neither need by incorrect or immature. You understand Finnegans Wake. It may fall on you as a happy wreck's debris hits the street or is sucked out to see, it might rule over you as queenly puns or prestigious parents, but parents are always progeny, too, queens are moved about quite easily when you are playing the right games, salvage has charms to muse as sooth (or something similarly reaching).The book is about a mountain and a river and as anyone who has played king of the mountain or water games knows, if you take the games too seriously, the conquest as more important than the play, you probably end up having a miserable time every moment you aren't on top. Give up the conquest and go for the play! Jump in, splash about, climb to see what you can where you can, and to jump that much further and make that much bigger a splash when down you crash! And ignore anyone who tells you, you can't backstroke along a mountain or climb up water; ""Any landing you walk away from,"" they say, ""is a good one,"" and that includes the landing at the top of the stairs, the height where you're king of the hill, or the muddle of the river rushes."
Finnegans Wake,"A daring work of experimental, Modernist genius, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is one of the greatest literary achievements of the twentieth century, and the crowning glory of Joyce's life. The Penguin Modern Classics edition of includes an introduction by Seamus Deane 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs' Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter's mental illness. If you enjoyed Finnegans Wake, you might like Virginia Woolf's The Waves, also available in Penguin Classics.

He is best known as the author of the Dune series. However, Herbert wrote many other fine works of futuristic literary art. One such is Herbert's 1972 novel Hellstrom's Hive, a new edition of which has just been put out by Tor Books.Hellstrom's Hive depicts an America that is ruled by a dictatorship. One dissident was a Doctor Nils Hellstrom who created a Project 40 that he persuaded the government to fund, but which Hellstrom was using as a secret laboratory. Upon discovering Hellstrom's duplicity, the dictatorship sends a special team of agents to shut down the lab.When the agents arrive, they discover that inside the lab there is stuff that places the entire planet's survival in peril. Or it could affect the future evolution of humanity. In any event, it is clear that the mad scientist Dr. Nils Hellstrom has created something truly insane that is nothing short of sick and twisted in its potential effect upon the innocent people of the world.Readers who try out this forgotten novel will be greatly satisfied by this tale of the future. It is heartily recommended."

I've tried Living Language, and I think its better because it comes with a book to really learn the language, while listening to pronounciations. Although the CD by itself for the Living Language program would not be sufficient because at times it can be confusing listening in the car, it is a nice supplement to the book that comes with the program. I believe the best conversation learning tool is by Pimsleur. I learned to speak Brazillian Portuguese pretty quickly, and its amazing if you just want to get around in Brazil, but the downside is that without a book to go along with the CD, you won't be able to really learn the language in depth, in the reading and writing portions of language."

Cut to years later, when a precious stone is left to a relative. Complicated relationships and chaos abound in this mystery by Collins.Franklin Blake has been entrusted with delivering the stone to its heir. His decision as to whether or not even give it to the girl is complicated by its history. He does giver Rachel the stone, and from the evening of her birthday until over a year later their lives are both turned upside down with the disappearance of the moonstone.The fun part of this book is trying to figure out who stole the moonstone. Collins will lead you in one direction while subtly pointing you in another. Pretty soon you're going to suspect so many people you'll wonder if it will ever be figured out. Well, I had a couple of choice suspects, but I couldn't figure out if they really were the culprits, and if they were, just how in the heck did they get away with it? Needless to say, I was justified in my suspicions, yet still surprised as to how Collins describes the way the mystery was solved. Franklin Blake very much reminds me of another Collins character, a Walter Hartwright from The Woman in White. (I highly recommend that one!)"
The Name of War: King Philip's War and the Origins of American Identity,"Winner of the Bancroft Prize King Philip's War, the excruciating racial war—colonists against Indians—that erupted in New England in 1675, was, in proportion to population, the bloodiest in American history. Some even argued that the massacres and outrages on both sides were too horrific to ""deserve the name of a war."" The war's brutality compelled the colonists to defend themselves against accusations that they had become savages. But Jill Lepore makes clear that it was after the war—and because of it—that the boundaries between cultures, hitherto blurred, turned into rigid ones. King Philip's War became one of the most written-about wars in our history, and Lepore argues that the words strengthened and hardened feelings that, in turn, strengthened and hardened the enmity between Indians and Anglos. Telling the story of what may have been the bitterest of American conflicts, and its reverberations over the centuries, Lepore has enabled us to see how the ways in which we remember past events are as important in their effect on our history as were the events themselves.

""His back legs were paralyzed and he was dragging himself along.

These delightful, at time hilarious, side characters bring a wonderful flavor and variety to the novel as, one by one, they are drawn into the bright circle of Ellen's influence. There is humor, danger, romance, and a beautiful longing for the world as it was and as it should be among the pages of this book. Ibbotson's light, lyrical writing flowed through each chapter, like the glissandi and grace notes of the music that is so central to its theme. And at is core is Ellen, a girl who is both strong and domestically inclined. The daughter and niece of dyed in the wool suffragettes, she is independent and smart and firmly chooses baking over marching. And, as so many of the characters do, reading this book means falling in love with her.This was my first Eva Ibbotson book and I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it. I have to say, finding a fabulous debut author is a delightful experience. But is there anything that compares with the tingle of discovering a wonderful established author, who already has six or seven books out there ready and waiting and in paperback?

A traitor to your people . . . Eager to do the white man's bidding. These are some of the modern connotations of an ""Uncle Tom."" Yet, if you were to read the book from which the term originated, you cannot help but come to an entirely different conclusion.""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" tells the story of a middle-aged slave, Tom, and his exploits in 1850s America. A staunch abolitionist, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote this novel as an illustration of the inherent evils of the system of slavery, not just in the actual practice of it, but also in the passive condoning of it by Northerners. The book was so effective that it swayed public opinion and helped bring forth the Civil War, as implied by Abraham Lincoln.The book is divided into three parts: The Shelby farm in Kentucky; The St. Clares' home in New Orleans; and wicked Simon Legree's plantation in rural Louisiana. The first two slaveowners are benevolent toward Tom, yet Stowe makes a powerful argument of the evils of slavery even when the slaveowner is upright and kind. Stowe portrays slaves as humans with real feelings and strong family ties - a bold pronouncement for that era. For even if they are in a kind environment, they are just one bad business deal or one untimely death away from being sold ""down river"" and being separated from all they love forever.Since the target audience was Christian, Stowe makes illustrious use of religious passages and uses flowery language at times, which may seem a bit too much for the modern reader. Yet, she uses these references effectively in an appeal to Christian love to all people, regardless of race. Furthermore, she condemns the Southern Christians of the time for twisting their belief to rationalize slavery.As for modern criticisms of the book, it is true that Tom is a loyal servant and wants to please his masters. However, he is no ""Uncle Tom,"" in that he never sells out his fellow slaves and would rather die than betray his brethren. He is treated as a martyr, a near Christ-like figure who will die if others can become free. I doubt Stowe could have portrayed Tom otherwise and still have been as effective. If Tom was rebellious toward his master rather than loyal and loving, the book would have lost its edge.Overall, this is a great read and provides a window into the thinking of an abolitionist. I'd highly recommend this for anyone who wants to know about the real Uncle Tom."

The beginning is filled with Stowe's rendition of slave's speech--""ah's gwyne ter make corn pone fer Mas'r""--which most modern readers will find demeaning. Fortunately this tones down.As a non-religious person I have a low tolerance for preachifyin, but it bothered me less as the novel progressed, as it became obvious that the most effective argument against slavery at the time was righteous Christianity. The issue was not the equality of the races, though Stowe does allow for that (not bad for 1850!), but that a Christian should not own humans, period. Whether the slaves were happy-go-lucky, sentimental, childlike, superstitious--all these supposed attributes of one race or another--all these were irrelevant to her.Through the character of St Clare she argues that the greater sin of slave owners was their hypocrisy rather than the ownership per se. That owners might claim justification from some obscure passage in the Bible was an outrage. Better to simply admit that you hold slaves because you have the power to do so, and it makes your life easier. If you are to be wicked, admit it at least--don't hide behind some nonsensical religious rationalization. If the slave owners could be honest about their reasons, then there might be hope of winning the moral argument.The characters are one-dimensional--pure good, pure evil, not much in between. Most are what we now see as stereotypes. They merely function as tools of the plot and the point. What I didn't expect was that the story itself would be as exciting as it was. It moves right along. This overcomes the preachiness and the simplicity of the characters, and is the reason so many read the book. Even for all its patronizin and preachifyin, it's a page-turner.As others have noted it is amazing to see how ""Uncle Tom"", portrayed as noble and saintly, has become such a term of derision.Finally, if you are going to read this, don't read the Introduction until after you've read the novel, as it gives away several plot points that you are better off encountering for yourself in the novel."
rachel Ray,"Rachael Ray presents 125+ recipes straight from her home kitchen in upstate New York, with personal stories on loss, gratitude, and the special memories that make a house a home. “I wanted to write this book because for the first time in my fifty-two years, everyone on the planet was going through the same thing at the same time. We were all feeling the same fear, heartsickness, worry, and sadness, but due to the nature of the virus, it was hard to connect. I connect through cooking, and I noticed that’s what many others were doing as well. We took to the kitchen to share something of ourselves—and cooking became the discipline, diversion, and devotion that got us through.” You may think you know Rachael Ray after decades of TV appearances and dozens of books, but 2020 changed us all and it changed her, too—her life and her direction. During the early months of the pandemic in upstate New York, far away from her New York City television studio, Rachael Ray and her husband, John, went to work in their home kitchen hosting the only cooking show on broadcast TV. At her kitchen counter, with the help of her iPhone cameraman (John), Rachael produced more than 125 meals—everything from humble dishes composed of simple pantry items (One-Pot Chickpea Pasta or Stupid Good, Silly Easy Sausage Tray Bake) to more complex recipes that satisfy a craving or celebrate a moment (Porcini and Greens Risotto or Moroccan Chicken Tagine).

Green Darkness,"“The theme of this book is reincarnation, an attempt to show the interplay—the law of cause and effect, good and evil, among certain individual souls in two periods of English history.” Green Darkness is the story of a great love, a love in which mysticism, suspense, and mystery form a web of good and evil forces that stretches from Tudor England to the England of the twentieth century. The marriage of the Englishman Richard Marsdon and his young American wife, Celia, slowly turns tragic as Richard withdraws into himself and Celia suffers a debilitating emotional breakdown. A wise mystic realizes that Celia can escape her past only by reliving it. She journeys back four hundred years to her former life as the servant girl Celia de Bohun during the reign of Edward VI—and to her doomed love affair with the chaplain Stephen Marsdon. Although Celia and Stephen can't escape the horrifying consequences of their love, fate (and time) offer them another chance for redemption.",['Anya Seton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gZLTAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gZLTAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Green+Darkness&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2013-10-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gZLTAAAAQBAJ&dq=Green+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],16.0,B000GQDSDY,,AZ4L4KIOSL8OI,Herb Garden,0/0,5.0,1264377600,Excellant Read!,"Anya Seton is a wonderful writer and Green Darkness is a great read.

If they had 'gotten together' in their previous lives why would there be any conflict/story to tell? This is not a cheesy romance novel. There's so much more to it than that. Perhaps it is the fault of the publishers for billing it as such. As far as liking Celia, I don't think we're supposed to like her. She has to be shown as flawed and why there are karmic dues to be paid. Whether you believe in reincarnation or not, it is the theme of this story. Dr. Akananda and Master Julien have to sacrifice for Celia to pay their own karmic dues. It is inferred that in a previous incarnation in ancient Greece. Dr. A./Master J. abandoned Celia and Ursula. This is his chance to make up for it. Celia did try to move on-she had schemed to win approval to marry a rich titled young man when Stephen reappeared in her life which led to her decision to give him the Water Witch's potion. Would Stephen have renounced his vows if not for that? There are many layers to this story. Please give this book a try if you like historical fiction at it's best."
Green Darkness,"“The theme of this book is reincarnation, an attempt to show the interplay—the law of cause and effect, good and evil, among certain individual souls in two periods of English history.” Green Darkness is the story of a great love, a love in which mysticism, suspense, and mystery form a web of good and evil forces that stretches from Tudor England to the England of the twentieth century. The marriage of the Englishman Richard Marsdon and his young American wife, Celia, slowly turns tragic as Richard withdraws into himself and Celia suffers a debilitating emotional breakdown. A wise mystic realizes that Celia can escape her past only by reliving it. She journeys back four hundred years to her former life as the servant girl Celia de Bohun during the reign of Edward VI—and to her doomed love affair with the chaplain Stephen Marsdon. Although Celia and Stephen can't escape the horrifying consequences of their love, fate (and time) offer them another chance for redemption.",['Anya Seton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gZLTAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gZLTAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Green+Darkness&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2013-10-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gZLTAAAAQBAJ&dq=Green+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],16.0,B000GQDSDY,,A14SIMJXDUSEBW,A.

On first inspection the most remarkable thing about Valentine Michael Smith was his circumstance of birth and subsequent upbringing in a strange land, however it is not until Valentine Michael Smith is brought 'home' that we have to wonder if his is the strange land, or it is ours?However you looked at it, biologically Valentine Michael Smith was human, even if his beliefs and ways were not. But is genetics alone enough to define man? As he begins to learn about his new 'home' and its people, many social, philosophical and religious question are raised. What is it to be a man, to be human? What is truth? What is God?As it turns out Valentine Michael Smith may be no more a man than he is a Martian. He is a race of one having to learn to change his ways to conform to human society, or failing that change human society to conform to his ways. A feat that may be more plausible then it sounds, at least for one as unique as the 'Man From Mars'.STrANgER IN A StRANgE LAnD is a deeply thoughtful and undeniably compelling read; this is not a book to be skimmed through and passed off as mere fantasy alone but a story to be taken in and grokked as best as possible. It is easy to see why they had wanted to ban this book with its themes of sexuality, religion, society and morals. Themes that are as relevant today as they were when this book was first written.(1961, in case you were wondering.)Having never read the original, previously released shortened edition, I can not say for sure how much this story has changed being the uncut version, but I can say that if you have never read this book, either version I'm sure, then you are greatly missing out on one of the most cultural, philosophical and religious discussions ever committed to literature."

Not just in volume, but in the power it expresses through its ideas. Philip K. Dick said good science fiction should be a reflection of the current society, using science fiction to get away with heretical things. (Well, he said something like that.) And I think that this book does that well. Very well. The main character brought up on Mars by Martians, in such an alien culture that there's nothing similar at all to Earth, becomes a mirror to everything moral and normal. For the main character Western attitudes towards sex and religion are alien topics and his actions and our actions are incompatible. To the point where he sets his own commune up and is persecuted for doing so.Generally the book has very little science in it at all. It uses the science as a tool to deal with plot points that we don't need to be bogged down with. Generally it's all about the dialogue: the discussion and analysis between characters, and the changes they under go. Oddly, Heinlein was still stuck in his world view of both society and technology of the 50s. It had the feel of being futuristic and old world. We have flying cars but still tape feed film cameras. It's a society very much stuck in the Western capitalist world view, and there's very little discussion of non Western ways of thinking.But reading it now, it doesn't seem as shocking as it must have been to warrant removal of 60,000 words. But it did have the words taken out, so it must have been shocking. An act of self-censorship enforced by the gatekeepers of the time. Is it shocking now? No, I don't think so. Society has moved on and we need something much more shocking to wake us up out of the stupor that we inhabit now."

The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.""Tess of the D'urbervilles"" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this ""modern"" society."

Thoreau organizes the book around a single trip to Provincetown, although much of the material that he uses in the book came from various visits to the Cape, and to the ocean in general. He starts with a description of a shipwreck at Cohasset, then a stagecoach ride from Plymouth, then a walking trip with a companion along the outer shore to Provincetown. Along the way, he describes not only the plants and animals he encountered, but also the people who he met. The book finishes with a lengthy academic historical account of the discovery and mapping of the Cape.I found this to be the most humorous of all Thoreau's work. The character sketches he provides in this book, sharpened with his trained eye for observation of natural phenomena, are legendary. The cultural description of the Cape and its environment is quite fascinating for those interested in the history of daily life in 19th century Massachusetts. As Thoreau describes the desolate, treeless desert that made up the far reaches of the Cape, one begins to comprehend what it meant for an economy to be based on wood and whale oil for fuels. Thoreau stresses how valued driftwood was for residents of the Cape, as one of their main sources of heating and cooking fuel. Doubtless, he would not recognize the Cape today with its lush new forests. Or its Wal-Marts--switching to an oil economy has brought mixed blessings for the Cape. For those who think Thoreau to be a humorless didactic philosopher, this book shows a very different aspect of Thoreau as a writer."
Shades (Wesleyan Poetry Series),"Shades is a book of shadow and light cast between trees and sun, between day and room, between life and death. It acknowledges endings as beginnings; it offers compassion and tenderness, searching for hope in the richness of nature; it seeks the same resources within the human being. Heather McHugh’s companion volume to To the Quick (Wesleyan 1987) continues the music and brilliance characteristic of her work but moves more deeply into the metaphysical. She writes in paradox, with serious wit and intensity, the crafted language of “stitches in hand and birds in time”; “We part/ before we part; indeed,/ we part before we meet…” She studies “going matched with coming.” She begins with a series of elegies that bring sexuality and death into brutal juxtaposition. Living and dying are the occasions of these poems, the soul the ultimate concern.

Her main concerns seem to be time and language, drawing from relationships.

(&quot;Language wasn't any / funny money I was playing with, / no toy surprise&quot; and &quot;But now I'm dumb / to frame the stream / of stills I feel&quot; and, touching them together, &quot;a bill of silver senselessness--the seconds counted / in the hundreds, in the thousands, in the billions, till the till&quot;)It gave me great pleasure to read this book and I recommend it."

Frank Capra made it by himself, he endured poverty, humiliation, and disappointment. He had brains, artistic sensitivity, and a boundless store of energy. As the son of immigrants he was given nothing except a work ethic. He worked his way through Cal Tech and got an engineering degree. With little job opportunity after graduation, he bummed it for a while over the southwest. Then he landed a job writing gags for Mack Sennett. He grew from there by writing screenplay. Capra was at his creative best when portraying realistic themes. The next step was directing, where he carried his realism to the top. Early in his career, Capra saw the Academy Award as the sign of artistic excellence,and set out to win one. He poured every ounce of his creative energies into his films. On several occasions he knew he deserved an Oscar, only to be disappointed again. Then he made it with &quot;It Happened One Night.&quot; Yet to Capra everything went wrong in making the movie: the wrong leading man, the rewrites, the arguments, the mistakes, the frustrations, the last minute changes. Your first Oscar is your toughest. After that Oscars came naturally to Capra, and he won a bundle of them. Now his &quot;name was above the movie title&quot; on the marquee. The book chronicles the making of his best films, each more interesting than the last. But Capra was more than Holloywood. He stood for artistic integrity and decency. He was generous and willing to help others; he also had his ememies, and was large of ego. He gave unsparingly of himself during WWII as the officer in charge of making Allied training and propaganda films. There's more about this man, much more. Its worth every moment of your reading time. Next Christmas, when they run &quot;Its A Wonderful Life&quot; on TV again, I guarantee you will appreciate the film more than ever. I would recommend this book to film buffs, and lovers of history or biography."
To lose a battle; France 1940,"To Lose a Battle: France 1940 is the final book of Alistair Horne's trilogy, which includes The Fall of Paris and The Price of Glory and tells the story of the great crises of the rivalry between France and Germany. In 1940 Hitler sent his troops to execute the Fall of France. A six-week battle with lightning 'blitzkrieg' warfare and combined operations techniques, the offensive ended the Phony War and sent the French forces reeling as their government fled from occupied Paris. For the Axis, it was a dramatic victory. But how was this spectacular result possible? In To Lose a Battle Alistair Horne tells the day-by-day, moment-by-moment story of the battle, sifted from the vast Nazi archives and the fragmentary records of the beaten Allies. Using eye-witness accounts of battle operations and personal memoirs of leading figures on both sides, this book steps far beyond the confines of military accounts to form a major contribution to our understanding of this important period in European history. 'Alistair Horne really brings home the pathos and human folly of war, and he writes brilliantly' The Times 'Horne follows his line unfalteringly. All the details are there: the small, fleeting triumphs, the greater disasters, the bravery, the cowardice, the stupidity and the intelligence ... that make war so fascinating and so terrible' Economist 'Horne completes his masterly trilogy ... the definitive account of one of the most efficient and astonishing campaigns of all time' The Times Literary Supplement One of Britain's greatest historians, Sir Alistair Horne, CBE, is the author of a trilogy on the rivalry between France and Germany, The Price of Glory, The Fall of Paris and To Lose a Battle, as well as a two-volume life of Harold Macmillan.",['Alistair Horne'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BopPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=BopPEAAAQBAJ&dq=To+lose+a+battle%3B+France+1940&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin,2007-11-27,http://books.google.com/books?id=BopPEAAAQBAJ&dq=To+lose+a+battle%3B+France+1940&hl=&source=gbs_api,['History'],4.0,B0006D5ILW,,A2BYPYO39GNMMM,Al,0/0,4.0,1361232000,Interesting look at a debacle,"This is a superior narrative history of the fall of France in 1940. Horne examines the political and social changes in France following the end of WW I, and how these affected the French military and their ability to resist the German invasion in 1940. Horne examines the diplomatic and political attempts to resist, in addition to the ineffective military response by the French army and air force. Horne utilized an amazing number of sources and his narrative reads as a novel. I was completely absorbed by this book, and what I found particularly interesting was his examination of all aspects of the Maginot Line. I highly recommend this book, as well as his other work, The Price of Glory: Verdun, 1916."
Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman,"""'O.J.R.I.L. (Old Jokes and Ridiculously Irrelevant Links): The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman' holds the distinction of being the only book ever published in the entire history of Western civilization with this title. (Although 'O.J.R.I.L.: The Completely Incomplete Graham Greene' came frighteningly close.) As if this great feat were not enough, this book also comprises a new collection of four unpublished, (and mostly) unproduced scripts by the late Graham Chapman of the legendary Monty Python's Flying Circus troupe."" ""The scripts include the much-rumored, but never produced, 1974 American TV special, 'Our Show For Ringo Starr', co-written with Douglas Adams. 'Jake's Journey', a TV sitcom filmed but never released, that was commissioned for CBS-TV. (It involves the misadventures of an American teenager in London and is very loosely based on 'A Connecticut Yankee in the Court of King Arthur'.) 'The Concrete Inspector' was written as a half-hour short-feature, and 'Tonight: VD' is a brief sketch written shortly before Graham Chapman's death in 1989. (""Must we all be so juvenile?

Including the very short ""VD"", ""Jake's Journey"", a pilot for an American sitcom written immediately prior to Graham's death, the odd conceptual piece ""The Concrete Inspector"", and the hilarious highlight of the book written in collaboration with the equally offbeat Douglas Adams, ""Our Show For Ringo Starr"", which was a avant-garde script for an hour long TV show promoting Ringo's then current album ""Goodnight Vienna"". (The best line is when Ringo gets to say: ""The concept of a four-dimensional space-time continuum inevitably suggests that the universe looks like a prawn omelette."") I found ""Jake's Journey"" a bit tedious and formulaic, and the Ringo piece utterly brilliant, with everything else falling somewhere in between. Also of great use to the collector is a 'Chapmanography' of videos, recordings and books in which Graham somehow contributed.This book is a very quick read, and I recommend it to people interested in Graham or Monty Python, just realize that it really isn't a biographical work as much as a set of quirky skits."

The author, James Joyce, lays his soul bare to the world with this thinly-disguised autobiography of growing up in and around Dublin, and in the process leaves generations of the world's smartest people confused about who he really was. Somewhere, hopefully, the man is smiling.The book begins and ends with a journey. In the beginning, it's the storybook tale of a ""moocow"" going down a road to meet a boy, one Stephen Dedalus. At the end, it's Stephen himself, now a young man, who is readying himself to depart the cradle of Ireland for parts unknown. In between, there's not that much of a plot, just snapshots of Dedalus at various key points of his emotional, spiritual, and mental development. Characters slip in and out of the narrative without the author making much of their fate, much as it is in life. ""Portrait"" feels like life in that and other ways, Dedalus and Joyce processing the world around them in bits and pieces.That's the boldness of ""Portrait"" for me, not its stray bits of stream-of-consciousness but the way it retains a wholly subjective and impressionistic view from beginning to end. You feel always like you are inside Joyce's head. Dedalus loses his innocence but never his vulnerability, and for that he retains our interest. Joyce's vivid descriptions and careful character development makes ""Portrait"" a book that seems to actually hold the soul of a man within its pages.""He wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld,"" Joyce writes at one early point, while Stephen is fantasizing about women but actually undertaking the wider challenge of adulthood. ""He did not know where to seek it or how: but a premonition which led him on told him that this image would, without any overt act of his, encounter him.""What you get reading this book is a rare bird indeed, a celebration of the imagination both in its form and in content. Stephen goes from dutiful child to pubescent sex fiend to pious schoolboy, each time feeling the need for something more. His climactic refusal to serve his Easter duty (ironically the book was published in 1916, the year of Ireland's Easter Rebellion) makes for a kind of statement of principle that gives the book a sense of purpose and uplift, even if you, like Joyce perhaps, aren't clear as to what it all means.Joyce's books after this got terribly cute and recondite. But here you get something very powerful and immersive. Even chapter five, where Dedalus spends a lot of time lecturing his college mates about his theories on beauty, Joyce keeps things grounded with impressionistic details and narrative handholds like his friend Cranly's chewing remorselessly on a fig. It's a challenging book, but a fair challenge that rewards you multifold for your effort.My old 1968 Viking paperback edited by Chester Anderson includes copious annotations (best left aside for a second reading, they spoil Joyce's careful rhythm and flow) and several essays. One, by Wayne Booth, asks an interesting question about whether Joyce was seriously presenting Stephen as pure artist or was sending Stephen (and thus himself) up as a kind of poseur. I enjoyed this essay very much for the way it has at ""Portrait,"" but I enjoyed ""Portrait"" itself much more. So will you."

Liming worked with Schmued to mathematically analyze the Mustang's shapes, tangents and curvatures. Schmued wrote an introduction to Liming and Hartley's series of articles for Aero Digest explaining the use of conics. These articles (along with the success of the Mustang) showed that NAA was ahead of it's time during WWII."
The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses,"When Celia Lyttelton visited a bespoke perfumers, she realized a long-held ambition: to have a scent created solely for her. Entering this heady, exotic world of oils and essences, she was transported from a leafy London square to a place of long-forgotten memories and sensory experiences. And once drawn into this world, she felt compelled to trace the origins, history and culture of the many ingredients that made up her unique perfume... And so began a magical journey of the senses that took Celia from Grasse, the cradle of perfume, to Morocco; from the rose-growing region of Isparta in Turkey, to the Tuscan hills where the iris grows wild. And after journeying to Sri Lanka, the home of the heavenly scented jasmine, Celia ventured to India, the Yemen and finally to the 'Island of Bliss', Socotra. Here she traced the rarest and most mysterious agent in perfumery, ambergris, which is found in the bellies of whales and is said to have powerful aphrodisiac qualities. From the peasants and farmers growing their own crops, and the traders who sell to the great perfume houses, to the 'noses' who create the scents and the marketing kings who rule this powerful billion-dollar industry, Celia Lyttelton paints a mystical, sensual landscape of sights, sounds and aromas as she recalls the extraordinary people and places she encountered on her unique Scent Trail.",['Celia Lyttelton'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oKNbSAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=oKNbSAAACAAJ&dq=The+Scent+Trail:+A+Journey+of+the+Senses&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bantam,2011-02-28,http://books.google.com/books?id=oKNbSAAACAAJ&dq=The+Scent+Trail:+A+Journey+of+the+Senses&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Perfumes'],,0553815490,,A2IIB10X0CECYV,Debbie,3/4,3.0,1271116800,"Interesting, but not quite what I was expecting","""The Scent Trail"" is a travelogue focused around finding the ingredients for the author's custom-created perfume.

She then traveled to France, Morocco, Turkey, Italy, Sri Lanka, India, Yemen, and Socotra to personally buy the ingredients for her perfume.Along the way, she gave snippets of interesting history and information about the perfume trade. We also learn about the countries (especially as regards the perfume trade) and the history of the perfume ingredients: mimosa, neroli, petitgrain, damask rose, iris, nutmeg, jasmine, vetivert, frankincense, myrrh, and ambergris. She also summarized the conversations she had with several perfumers and described tours of several buildings where the ingredients are distilled or made into concentrate or absolutes for the perfume trade.

However, I would have found some pictures helpful as I had a hard time picturing some of the places and things she described.People who are interested in both foreign countries and perfume will probably find this memoir/travelogue interesting.Reviewed by Debbie from Different Time, Different Place book reviews(differenttimedifferentplace. blogspot. com)"
"Cathedral (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Mission Gamma, Book 3)","“Addison Cain's writing blows me away each time!” NYT Bestselling author Anna Zaires My love for her is forbidden. When the princess was placed in my care, the devil ordered that I never show his daughter mercy, affection, or a gentle hand. To keep her safe from the denizens of our dark king’s Cathedral, Jade’s life as my ward has been pitiless. She despises me. Yet I am utterly, irrevocably in love. Infamous for my coldness, unquestioned in my fealty, the devil forgets that there are older, more terrible monsters in the dark—and I have sold my soul to the most ancient of evil so that Jade might one day be mine.

With this introduction, Russell discusses some problems: the physical world, man from without (environment), man from within (consciousness, emotions, ethics etc) and so on. An outline is clearly limited, and Russell does not include many branches of philosophical enquiry such as metaphysical inquiry and some aspects of authority and state.

The 19th century rule changes that have affected individual player stats from that period are, in particular, flatly presented, and offer no insight or logic train to support there over-all impact. As well, the editorial writing occasional borders on the self-absorbed; and the actual paper used is easily crumpled, while the binding won't last the summer if you are an active reader.All in all, however, it is a 'must have' for the ardent fan, especially if you want an (albeit limited) introduction into the world of sabermetrics and situational stats."
The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus,"Nostradamus began to write his prophetic verses in the city of Salon, in 1554. They are divided into ten sections called Centuries (which refers to the number of verses in each section, not to a unit of 100 years). The Centuries were published in 1555 and 1558, and have been in print continuously ever since. Nostradamus had the visions which he later recorded in verse while staring into water or flame late at night, sometimes aided by herbal stimulants, while sitting on a brass tripod. The resulting quatrains (four line verses) are oblique and elliptical, and use puns, anagrams and allegorical imagery. Most of the quatrains are open to multiple interpretations, and some make no sense whatsoever. Some of them are chilling, literal descriptions of events, giving specific or near- specific names, geographic locations, astrological configurations, and sometimes actual dates. It is this quality of both vagueness and specificity which allows each new generation to reinterpret Nostradamus.",['Nostradamus'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UNlQnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UNlQnwEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Prophecies+of+Nostradamus&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,CreateSpace,2013-12,http://books.google.com/books?id=UNlQnwEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Prophecies+of+Nostradamus&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],,B000C1ZX6S,,A30KEXFT9SILL6,"frumiousb ""frumiousb""",16/17,3.0,954288000,Really Reading Nostradamus,"Actually, for the text itself, I give it four stars, while I only give the commentary two.First, Nostradamus-- I'll admit that I'm more or less uninterested in the prophecy side of the verses. I was interested in reading them for their historical value. As such, it's a great read. Through the verses, you get a look at the period's preoccupations-- who is named pope, the future of France, alchemy, and the desire to distinguish prophecy from astrology. Nostradamus has had an enduring impact on writing since he put his prophecies on paper, and you can trace that legacy here from the original verses.The commentary-- Henry C. Robert's interpretation taught me more about World War II than anything else-- he seemed determined to prove that a disproportionate number of the verses referred to the second World War. Probably unsurprising, given that he first wrote his interpretations in 1947. However, he stretched so hard to fit the words to his ideas, that it unfortunately made me suspect his translation. I also could have done with more of an effort for establishing on what basis he was assigning some of the meanings (explanation of period symbolism, the alchemical references, etc.).If I get a chance to buy another translation version and compare, I probably will."

Not every artist's style appealed to me but I can appreciate their processes, their techniques, and the way their individual works fit into the whole.Not a how-to book, but full of ideas.

None of the chapters were difficult to get through, and I found it really strengthened my basic knowledge of scary things like IRAs, term life insurance, and filing systems.I wouldn't recommend this book if you're single, as it's directed toward couples. Both people must also be committed to reading the book as well; his 9-step plan won't work very well if it's one-sided. I'm not entirely convinced that this plan will make me us millionaires by retirement (and we have a long way to go!), but it will definitely increase the wealth we have over the years. I was disappointed by his 9th step (which is essentially ""go make more money!""), but reading this book will make you more aware of where you want your money to be going and where it actually is.This is a perfect book for young couples, I may start giving it to friends as a wedding gift."

You can read this book in an afternoon on the couch with a cup of tea. It's on the whimsical side, has its sweet moments and some smiles too. One thing I really appreciate is that there are no cleavage shots and none of that ""wow-we-are-still-hot"" energy. It's just a reminder of who we were, how we've moved through this life, and here we go for the rest of it. I loved the photos of the women in this book. Real women, with real wrinkles and sometimes grey hair, any one of them could be a friend of mine. In truth, I was hoping for a bit more depth, but it was still worth my time. I guess in a way, even without the deeper kinds of conversations that I love, it's a little like just sitting with a friend you've known for years; it's just comfortable and easy."

Ideals and realities of Islam,,,,,,,,,,B0006BR4KM,,A2VE83MZF98ITY,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""",20/20,5.0,1078012800,A classic for understanding the heart of Islam,"Some twenty-five years ago, I had my first real exposure to the teachings of Islam, through the gentle teachings of my professor Victor Danner and this text by Seyyed Hossein Nasr. As the introduction states, there are few books in English which treat Islam from its own point of view. The two primary audiences are Westerners who wish to know something about Islam, both in ideal and in practice, as well as the Muslim who has received Western education.The chapters of this book each derive from lectures delivered at the American University in Beruit back in the 1960s; while one might think that this makes the text dated, this would be incorrect. Much in the way that the basic core of Christianity remains remarkably constant despite the progress of culture, so too does the heart of Islam. One of the interesting observations of the author is that Islam faces the same kind of modern crisis as Christianity, in that the younger generation has lost touch with the religion and faith of their ancestors; while this is particularly true in Muslim countries with Western educational models, it is increasingly true in other parts of the world, as many become 'cultural Muslims', but not religious Muslims.Seyyed Hossein Nasr does a good job at showing Islam in comparative terms, in a manner that those more familiar with other religious constructs (particularly Judaism and Christianity) will find intelligible. There are six major sections -- the first addresses Islam in general, placing it historically and philosophically as a universal religion as well as a particular religion, a primordial religion as well as the 'last' of the religions. The second explores the Quran (Koran), its development and place in Islam, the difficulties inherent in translation and interpretation, and the three main types of literature contained within the Quran. The third addresses the prophet himself, Mohammad, his life and history, as well as the development of his image and legacy beyond his life time. The fourth section is on the Shariah, or divine law, its derivation from the Quran and development over time. The fifth looks at Tariqah, Sufiism and the mystical side of Islam. Finally, the author looks at the major division of the Sunnite and Shiite groupings, some of the major contrasts as well as the similarities.The book has a wonderful spirit about it -- perhaps ironically for me, given my mystic and spirituality interests, the chapter that touched me most was that on the Shariah, the divine law, and made me for a time wish to study very deeply into the complexities and schools of Shariah, and develop the author's parallel he draws with the Talmud.This might be a bit difficult to come by, but in a time when it really pays to understand the major points and ideals of Islam, this is a book that deserves to be read and studied."

The story takes little time to let the reader know from the very get go what the story is to be about. This is one of the parts I found dissapointing. There was little left to surprise the reader. Jefferson a black man in the racist community is accused and convicted of a murder that he didn't commit. The Sentence Jefferson recieves is death. The rest of the book brings the reader along the emotional roller coaster of trying to teach Jefferson about being a man. This task is given to Grant Wiggins the community teacher. Althought doubtful about his given duty Mr. Wiggins not only turns Jefferson into a respectful man, but also learns about himself . In the end the inevitable happen and Jefferson is put to death but when the execution is looked back upon the jail guard who Mr. Wiggins became friends with during his many visits to the jail informed Mr. Wiggins that Jefferson was the bravest man in that room. This is the touching part of the book to see the transformation of Jefferson from someone who thought he was only a hog to being described as the bravest man in the room at his own execution. But this was not the only transformation througout the book, Mr. Wiggins also made a break through with his many visits learned much about himself and being himself and doing what makes him happy is the most important, rather than things or money. This book overall was very good I thought, it had a very good ending message and I enjoyed watching the changes in the characters the Gaines deleloped for the reader.

Perhaps because I read it as a fairy tale. A wonderfully romantic fairy tale. With magic, good over evil, and living happily ever after.I can understand one of the criticisms. The characters in the story did seem a bit flat. It felt to me that we weren&#65533;t given much time in the character&#65533;s heads; how they thought about things etc. But the relationships, within the context of the story, still seemed totally believable and endearing to me. Another criticism in the reviews I read was that the two story lines seemed disjointed. I have to disagree. I will admit, the first time the story switched to &#65533;Sometime Else&#65533;, I found it distracting and didn&#65533;t know what was going on. But then as the story progressed, the stories were drawn closer and closer together, and more relevant to each other, to the point of a complete connection at the end.And the story of The Prince and Brecia was WONDERFUL! I would LOVE to see an entire book dedicated just to them!This is a unique and fun story. I&#65533;ve read over 200 romance novels and consider this to be one of my favorites."

Rumors of Another World (What on Earth are we Missing?),"What on earth are we missing? Philip Yancey believes we are missing the supernatural hidden in everyday life.In Rumors of Another World, Yancey investigates the natural world and discovers the supernatural hiding in plain view. He grapples with why God made the world and what our role truly is, and seeks to answer the question, “How do I live in the natural world while expressing the values of the supernatural?”Philip writes, “I have come to understand faith as the highest form of integrated encounter. Faith puts together, assembles, re-orders, accepting the entire world as God’s handiwork. We live among clues, like rescuers sifting through pieces of stained glass shattered by a bomb, and only with a blueprint or some memory of original design can we begin to connect the shards, to assemble them into a pattern that makes sense of our world.“Nature and supernature are not two separate worlds, but different expressions of the same reality. To encounter the world as a whole, we need a more supernatural awareness of the natural world.”Yancey invites readers to join him on a journey of discovery. He challenges us to tune into “rumors of another world,” and connect the seen with the unseen. He promises that the grace-filled result will be a life of beauty, purpose, freedom, and faith.",['Philip Yancey'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bD2L03AA4yMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=bD2L03AA4yMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rumors+of+Another+World+(What+on+Earth+are+we+Missing%3F)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Zondervan,2009-05-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bD2L03AA4yMC&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],2.0,B000MS332C,,A29IKTVGLEBJ7J,Keri,0/0,5.0,1066435200,Great find!,"I am not a religious person and do not normally read books that would fall under that catagory.

A Sense of Place: An Intimate Portrait of the Niebaum-Coppola Winery and the Napa Valley,"In A Sense of Place, renowned wine expert and writer Steven Kolpan tells the story of how Francis Ford Coppola brought California's most distinguished and historic vineyard back to life. Gustave Niebaum's Inglenook Estate, started in 1879, was one of the Napa Valley's first established vineyards and the birthplace of its premium wine industry. Generations after Niebaum's death, the vineyard was sold to Heublein, the wine and spirits monolith, who broke up the land and changed the Inglenook brand from a premium, connoisseur wine to a mass-market jug wine. In 1975, Francis Coppola bought the Niebaum residence and the surrounding estate. Along with the original estate's reputation, he also brought back some of its original workers, including Rafael Rodriquez, who, in h is late seventies, now serves as the vineyard manager and historian. Coppola overcame naysayers, red tape, and financial turmoil to reestablish the winery as a defender of quality, producing wine under four different labels, including the revered wine Rubicon. In 1995, Coppola purchased the Inglenook Chateau and its adjacent vineyards, fulfilling his dream of reuniting the original Napa Valley estate. Kolpan's luscious, flavorful narrative is worth enjoying now and keeping for later.",['Steven Kolpan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mZDIK-CiduEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=mZDIK-CiduEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Sense+of+Place:+An+Intimate+Portrait+of+the+Niebaum-Coppola+Winery+and+the+Napa+Valley&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2013-02-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=mZDIK-CiduEC&dq=A+Sense+of+Place:+An+Intimate+Portrait+of+the+Niebaum-Coppola+Winery+and+the+Napa+Valley&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],,0415920043,,,,2/2,5.0,944784000,An intimate Portrait,"I found A Sense of Place to be exactly what the title describes - an intimate portrait of the Niebaum-Coppola Winery.

Coppola writes in the forward, &quot;In, America, very few things that are split apart are ever put together again.

Your love language is the way that you most feel loved and cared for. The problem is most people love how they want to be loved, and that doesn't tend to align with how their partner wants to be loved. So, you have to learn to speak your partner's love language. The author also believes that focusing intently on speaking the love languages will rekindle relationships where people don't even seem to like each other anymore.The relationship expert who wrote the book arranges the book into the five love languages, and provides quizzes to help you determine which language you are:- Words of Affirmation:If this is your love language, you feel most cared for when your partner is open and expressive in telling you how wonderful they think you are, how much they appreciate you, etc.Basically, they find ways to remind you that their world is a better place because you are in it.- Acts of Service:If your partner offering to watch the kids so you can go to the gym (or relieving you of some other task) gets your heart going, then this is your love language.- Affection:This love language is just as it sounds. A warm hug, a kiss, touch, and sexual intimacy make you feel most loved when this is your love language.- Quality Time:This love language is about being together, fully present and engaged in the activity at hand, no matter how trivial.- Gifts:Your partner taking the time to give you a gift can make you feel appreciated.My only critique is that they didn't focus more on understanding and discussing your emotions. For this you and your partner should readEmotional Intelligence 2.0. It did wonders for my husband and I."

Bono ""Riccardo""",1/1,5.0,1238976000,Required Reading on Fred Astaire,"Fred's way with words, his breezy light soaring style, reminds one of his dancing. This book is Fred-direct: the importance of his personal life, even over career, is paramount. As a read, it's a must for all interested a private man's life in filmed dance. It's completely enjoyable...if not particularly revealing about his art.At the end of the book, Fred mildly mocks the idea of over intellectualizing dance. Other than ""maintaining the basic principles of balance and grace"", he even questions a commitment to a particular style. He ends his story simply: ""I just dance."".That's Fred...but all the intensity, work, and preparation, and in his case, worry, that went into the creation of some of the greatest dance of the century...is sublimated in this wonderful book. Fred hardly even notes all the sweat that went into his art. That's Fred too.In the revealing introduction by the lovable, ever feisty, Ginger Rogers, he acknowledges her special, and highly reciprocal role in his career...and he in hers. And, in fact, as in her autobiography, neither of them were ever highly articulate about their art. Who cares?Today we know them from their films...and their artistry will be available to all the generations ahead. In this, their eternal realm, they were, and are, highly articulate...to say the least. ""Steps in Time"" and ""Ginger: My Story"", just whet the appetite to see the films...and in their chosen milieu...which for both of them...and especially for the solo-Fred...in spite of their considerable acting talents, meant one word...PERFORMANCE."

Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen),"Buffy and Angel find themselves launched into a frightening reality where fierce dragons and other fairy-tale monstrosities rule supreme. Once they locate each other, they rally the missing teens -- including Salma -- and attempt to make their way through the interdimensional portal back to Sunnydale. Little do they know that two unlikely allies have also come through to alternity: Spike and the rogue Slayer, Faith, both with their own respective -- and complicated -- MOs.Back in L.A., gang violence and vigilantism are at a fever pitch. The Slayerettes -- now an extended unit -- are holding down the fort, awaiting Buffy and Angel's return. But Slayer and Vampire are feeling moral conflict that rivals the physical strain of demon-slaying: each wonders if a reality exists where their love could have survived. And when one of the duo's charges is suddenly killed, the portal to Sunnydale is sealed.

Author Kristin Henderson certainly succeeds in bringing back that time of fear and confusion but what got me was her exploration of connections between the human urges to war and procreation. At the time her husband shipped out to Afghanistan, Henderson was struggling to come to terms with infertility--losing her dream of being a mother and the physical presence of her husband at the same time. Her road trip allowed her the time and solitude to sort through the pain and emotional confusion of all this while, as she says, giving her the illusion of forward motion. We are the lucky beneficiaries of this 'escape plan' as Henderson alternates her experiences on the road--often hooty, always interesting--with recollections of divisions in her self and her marriage over religion, and of the medical and emotional trials of fertility treatment. Reading this wonderful book, I sensed that Henderson, with her trusty dog Rosie at her side, would find the peace she was looking for and I was happy to be along for the vicarious ride."
Economics in one lesson (Pocket book),"With over a million copies sold, Economics in One Lesson is an essential guide to the basics of economic theory. A fundamental influence on modern libertarianism, Hazlitt defends capitalism and the free market from economic myths that persist to this day. Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication. Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy. Economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",['Henry Hazlitt'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&pg=PP1&dq=Economics+in+one+lesson+(Pocket+book)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Currency,2010-08-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A50iBxwt7qMC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],18.0,B0007EWJWG,,AXBM8YO0N0K1X,George Kucera,3/4,5.0,1300233600,Brilliant and Cogent...a rare combination,"Henry Hazlitt was a truly great writer. The arguments he develops are simply and clearly stated. While written in a way that any literate person can digest, this may not be a book for someone completely new to economics and government policy. However, if every student read this after an introductory primer on economics, I am confident the world would be a better place. Economics is of primal importance to society and everyone owes it to themselves and their children to make sure that this important knowledge is shared and not lost from our generation to the next. My kids will be reading this as one of their required books before graduating from high school. I also recommend anything from Murray Rothbard.

High-level language psuedo-code (not fictionaly assembly language) that's intuitively obvious would save us all so much trouble. But, why not a ""TAoCP in FORTRAN-90"", a ""TAoCP"" in APL, a ""TAoCP"" in COBOL, a ""TAoCP"" in BASIC, a ""TAoCP"" in LISP, a ""TAoCP"" in ALGOL, a ""TAoCP in Ada"", a ""TAoCP in C"", a ""TAoCP in Java"", etc. ?? Think of the money to be made re-selling it in every possible langauge if there's a market for it? I might even do it myself and make some $. LOL. Actually, there's no need for a Visual Basic version, etc. because language specific I/O, etc. is not the issue. This set is about art, about *algorithms*, so most of the high level language specific aspects are irrelevant (except for recursion, details like garbage collection, inheritance, polymorphism...).Equally irrelevant is worrying about efficient memory usage and the like. Today, memory, disk space, etc. are not scarce resources. While (being from the old school) I don't believe in wasteful code, all people really want today out of algorithms is optimal speed. Time and CPU power are the only resources that are still constraints (aside from transmission speed). Discussions about sort algorithms which optimize for anything else (memory space, etc.) are pointless if they aren't also the most time efficient. We don't care! Also, unless you work for the US Census or Social Security Administration, you don't care about hardware devices like magnetic tape drives, so those algorithms are just theoretical mind games. Anyway, please rewrite this set in a practical high level psuedo-code with time optimal algorithms only. But only the timeless (pun-intended) universally necessary algorithms that are always going to be useful. Stuff like searching, data structures, hashing, trade offs between techniques. In the future all people will want areparallel processing algorithms for distributed environments and perhaps eventually quantum computing algorithms for a language built on a CPU which only processes QBits.One final thing: wasn't there originally supposed to be 7 volumes and only these 3 were completed? What ever happened to the rest? [Update: After 32 years, Knuth is finally dribbling out volume 4.]"

Its hard to imagine this story is several hundred years old. The narrator did an excellent job of bringing Keene and the other crew members alive.Downside? I didn't like Keene as much as I liked some of his other protagonists. Keene is a liar, and his pranks are dangerous and not very funny. At times, I felt his bad behavior was rewarded, and his quest to be acknowledged by his father (who seemed a bit self-absorbed jerk to me), seemed pointless. Instead of being happy with who he is Keene, struggles and strives to be a nobleman which just seemed a bit meh. I also thought Keene became a bit of a snob towards the end, and the way he and his mother treated the poor marine father made me feel bad for him.Overall, this is an entertaining read, still quite relevant to modern day, but I would've liked it more if Keene had been a nicer person."
Pigs at the Trough: How Corporate Greed and Political Corruption Are Undermining America,"“Wonderfully incendiary and right-headed . . .Huffington is mad as hell, and rightly so.” –Esquire The scathing and insightful New York Times bestseller, now updated to include the current economic crisis Pigs at the Trough is Arianna Huffington’s eerily prescient exposé of the financial meltdown–and the flagrant greed that triggered it. Once again, Huffington takes on the nexus of corporate highfliers, lobbyists, and Washington insiders who have created and zealously protected a culture of corruption in America. Hearkening back to the days of Enron and WorldCom, she draws a line connecting those accounting frauds to the much larger and more sophisticated corruption that drove the latest financial crisis. The list of new culprits is long, and in this updated version of Pigs at the Trough, Huffington calls them out–including AIG, Citigroup, and Merrill Lynch–and asks the probing questions of how things went so wrong and how we can rebuild our free market capitalist system on a sounder moral foundation. Wickedly amusing yet powerfully indicting, Pigs at the Trough will once again stir up heated discussion among Americans outraged by the bailout of corporate swine. “With a passion for the truth and an eye for detail, Arianna Huffington reports on the hijacking of democracy. Read it and weep–then head for the barricades.”–Bill Moyers “Huffington indicts with precision, verve, and sparkling wit.” –Barbara Ehrenreich “Arianna Huffington makes an appealing and compelling argument for the repeal of human nature–that part of it that indulges savage, unconscionable, and despicable greed.” –Walter Cronkite",['Arianna Huffington'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gVoS07elgRwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=gVoS07elgRwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Pigs+at+the+Trough:+How+Corporate+Greed+and+Political+Corruption+Are+Undermining+America&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2009-07-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gVoS07elgRwC&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],2.0,B0001BJECI,,A33WUT56NXX0FO,"""rodionpunk""",4/4,4.0,1052092800,"Not bad, but a bit long winded.","If you've never thought about corruption in corporations and the government, then read this book cover to cover.

Kennedy's slim victory (less than 150,000 votes) over Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in 1960 was arguably the 20th century's most iconic. Kennedy's generation, ""born in this century,"" linked American history and heroes with still-modern inventions of instant polling and television to face the legacy of a beloved war hero president, his formidable vice-president and eight years of their ""peace and prosperity.""Theodore H. White's influential bestseller, ""The Making of the President 1960,"" not only chronicles the primaries, speeches, strategy sessions, debates, and final tallies, but was largely where 1960's election, and its victor, began owning their singular places in U.S. history.Beginning fittingly with Kennedy's stressful, exhilarating victory night, the book unfolds candidate strategies from primary to convention to the weeks between Bill Mazeroski's World Series-ending home run and that November 7. White is novelist, journalist and historian chronicling the Democratic torch passing from Adlai Stevenson (a reluctant if overpoweringly influential candidate) to Kennedy at the Los Angeles convention. With unprecedented access to Senator Kennedy, campaign manager Bobby Kennedy (provocatively described as a Catholic ""Boston Puritan""), and their brain trusts, White sketches the candidate's vigor, intellect, and humor making him the cultural equal to icons Franklin Roosevelt and Elvis Presley.With far less access to the then-vice president or his staff (part of Nixon's hostility to press which rose to paranoia a decade later) White's views on Nixon are observational, quotes from formal speeches or advisors speaking off-record. Eisenhower's Republican torch becomes a hot potato jumping from New York governor Nelson Rockefeller to industry captains supporting the party to what White describes as Nixon's mix of stubbornness (with a 50-state strategy), bad luck, bad TV imagery, and a touch of greed. This led Nixon to make strategically right over morally right decisions (both candidates' reaction to Dr. Martin Luther King's Georgia imprisonment weeks before the election being a watershed example.)But for its merits describing Kennedy and Nixon's exhausting marathon to the Oval Office (and hardships of accompanying staffers and even reporters), White's most valuable chapter for today's reader is ""Retrospect on Yesterday's Future."" Any political science or sociology student must read White's chronicle of 1960's changing demographics: contrasts between black/white, urban/suburban, regional/ethnic (""red"" and ""blue"" state values described spot-on without color) and, most notably, Catholic/Protestant. (Kennedy's famous speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association, taking his religious and presidential responsibilities head-on, is reprinted as an appendix.)White gives this humanity and immediacy making particular episodes (Nixon's Atlanta rally, Hubert Humphrey's long bus ride in Wisconsin and his awkward TV telethon, Kennedy's final speech as candidate in Connecticut) seem fresh and evocative. White shows 1960 slamming shut the ""simpler time"" many envision the 1950s to be. This not only stems from tragedies awaiting both men, but Big Media's ever-larger bytes and swallows of political discussion and drama.Anyone wanting to understand modern American politics, strategies and motivations in place even to this year's election must start here. ""The Making of the President 1960"" should be required for any voter helping to elect one in 2008 and beyond."

It pitted two very well known (nowadays) politicians against each other, Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Republican Vice President Richard M. Nixon of California.I thoroughly enjoyed the book from beginning to end. The first chapter is an account of election night from the Kennedy compound. We then go back to when the various candidates first made their decision to run for the presidency.It is interesting comparing how the political process worked back in 1960 compared to today. For the Democratic nomination, Kennedy and Humphrey decided to enter specific primary elections. This was a time when political bosses were still relevant. Candidates needed key victories in order to impress bosses to release their delegates at the convention. Other candidates, such as Johnson, did not choose this route.On the Republican side, Nixon pretty much had the nomination in the bag as soon as he wanted it. The only opposition was a short campaign by New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller.We get an exciting description of the conventions themselves.Then it was on to the general campaign. Each candidate worked almost non-stop campaigning until election day. Nixon had the advantage of being the incumbent Vice President, an office which requires little duty and had more time for campaigning while Kennedy, still Senator, worked in Washington eager to get out on the campaign trail.Kennedy opted for a more traditional campaign style. Hitting key states with the appropriate amount of electoral votes. Nixon wanted a wider campaign and pledged to campaign in all fifty states. A knee injury that landed him in the hospital almost cost him that, but he vowed to fulfill his pledge, which he eventually did.Then there were the famous debates. It was the first election in which television had a significant effect. Kennedy was the man who appeared smooth and in control while Nixon appeared unshaven, pale, and confused. Those listening on the radio thought Nixon did better while the television audience thought Kennedy won it.The election turned out to be one of the closest in American history. Although Kennedy easily won in the electoral college, he only won by a margin of 0.1% in the popular nationwide vote.Although I loved this book, it is not without its faults. The first is the historical problem. In the preface, the author does acknowledge this saying that no historian could ever fully write all the facts about contemporary events. So facts that came up later, such as allegations of electoral fraud in Illinois and Texas, are never mentioned.As has been mentioned about this book again and again, Kennedy is clearly White's favorite over Nixon. He did spend more time following the Kennedy campaign (whether or not this was due to Nixon's cynicism of the press I am unsure) so he spends more time on the Democratic side of the election. And again, like it says in the forward of this recent edition, if White knew about Kennedy's infidelity he did not mention it (which considering the times is not really that implausible).Today the election of 1960 is considered a landmark in retrospect. Kennedy is seen today as one of the most widely admired Presidents and, to many, it was a great loss to the nation when he was assassinated. Nixon, on the other hand, was later elected President in 1968 and then that Watergate thing came around and forever ruined his reputation and legacy. This book was written before all that happened. Before Kennedy's presidency was barely off the ground.I recommend this book for those interested in American history or political history. While it should not be considered a historical source, as it was written shortly after the election, it does a great job of telling the story of the 1960 election as if you are living through it."
Brothers K,"A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK Once in a great while a writer comes along who can truly capture the drama and passion of the life of a family. David James Duncan, author of the novel The River Why and the collection River Teeth, is just such a writer. And in The Brothers K he tells a story both striking and in its originality and poignant in its universality. This touching, uplifting novel spans decades of loyalty, anger, regret, and love in the lives of the Chance family. A father whose dreams of glory on a baseball field are shattered by a mill accident. A mother who clings obsessively to religion as a ward against the darkest hour of her past. Four brothers who come of age during the seismic upheavals of the sixties and who each choose their own way to deal with what the world has become. By turns uproariously funny and deeply moving, and beautifully written throughout, The Brothers K is one of the finest chronicles of our lives in many years. Praise for The Brothers K “The pages of The Brothers K sparkle.”—The New York Times Book Review “Duncan is a wonderfully engaging writer.”—Los Angeles Times “This ambitious book succeeds on almost every level and every page.”—USA Today “Duncan’s prose is a blend of lyrical rhapsody, sassy hyperbole and all-American vernacular.”—San Francisco Chronicle “The Brothers K affords the . . . deep pleasures of novels that exhaustively create, and alter, complex worlds. . . . One always senses an enthusiastic and abundantly talented and versatile writer at work.”—The Washington Post Book World “Duncan . . . tells the larger story of an entire popular culture struggling to redefine itself—something he does with the comic excitement and depth of feeling one expects from Tom Robbins.”—Chicago Tribune",['David James Duncan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rFg_h5iuOXkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=rFg_h5iuOXkC&pg=PA376&dq=Brothers+K&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Dial Press,2010-07-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rFg_h5iuOXkC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],33.0,B000N7AA3W,,A2RZUFRYRHTRS8,souldrummer,1/2,4.0,1121212800,"Massive book, very ambitious, but worth it","This novel is huge in its scope and the family it tries to portray. Fundamentalist Seventh Day Adventism and Baseball are the twin gods that birth the Chance family. Four wildly different brothers, 2 daughters and a host of secondary characters are followed for what must be 20+ years of adventures. What seems to be a family novel of a small town minor leaguer and the life in the shadow of his mill evolves into a mediation on Vietnam, Eastern religions, psychiatry and the need for simplicity in an increasingly chaotic world. Narrated by Kincaid, the youngest of the four brothers, each of the other three brothers make decisions that carry them far afield of their small town roots. Each must also decide whether to embrace, reject, or circumvent the opposing poles of father and mother in the family.I enjoyed this novel and I would recommend it to anyone with the time to stew in it for awhile. I felt that this novel could have been about 200 pages shorter and still effective. I didn't get all of the introductory quotes to the chapters which range from literature to Eastern religious texts to baseball quotes and poets. I enjoyed most of the tales of the chance family individually, but the conclusion of the book and all that it resolves does not need every episode to fulfill its importance.Initially I was turned off by this book because of the title ""The Brothers K"". Dostoevsky is alluded to at various points in the story but is less the central player than I thought he would be. It's been awhile since I read the Brothers Karamazov but I feel that ""The Brothers K"" strives to portray a family more than to ponder existential despair. From my vantage point, ""The Brothers K"" seems more explicitly humanitarian and more explicitly political but that may just be my greater familiarity with Viet Nam.I applaud Duncan's work even as I believe that he could have written a tighter novel. But I imagine he enjoyed birthing these characters so much that he had a hard time letting them go or abridging their stories.4.5 stars.--SD"

In part one, Lou shows where he thinks Karl Marx made his big mistake and says:The path the capitalist revolution will take faces in exactly the oppositedirection from that taken by the communist revolution. It seeks to diffusethe private ownership of capital instead of abolishing it entirely. It seeksto make all men capitalists instead of preventing anyone from being acapitalist by making the State the only capitalist.Part two of the book is Lou's program for the ""capitalist revolution."" It would help households become owners of corporate shares. They would pay for the shares through bank loans. Dividends on the shares would first repay the loans. After that, the dividends would be a major source of household income.Each element of the program calls for new legislation. One major government program would make credit easily available for households to invest in businesses. A ""Capital Diffusion Insurance Corporation"" would be federally chartered, to insure against some of the risks, such as the failure of a business to sell all of a securities offering and the catastrophe to a borrower from multiple business failures. This insurance is intended to lower the bank's interest rate so that the borrower's loan payments would be less than the expected dividends on the shares.To provide cash for loan repayment and household income, corporations would be required to pay out their entire net income in dividends. (Younger businesses could retain earnings for growth and reserves against risks.)Lou and I agreed about the need to broaden the ownership of capital and increase the number of individuals who could receive investment income, as a supplement to work earnings. We had three differences about how that could be done:1. Lou's programs placed an intermediary between the individual owners and the business. DPOs create a direct relationship between owners and management.2. Lou's programs require extensive government legislation and oversight. Direct offerings use the existing legal framework, without any special treatment.3. Lou's programs used Wall Street investment bankers, including Kelso & Co., in packaging and distribution. We have prepared electronic toolkits for use by the business itself in designing and completing direct offerings.Lou believed passionately that each of these three elements was necessary. He told me that the intermediary was needed because the new owners did not have the experience or training to manage direct investments. He said this was a temporary measure and could gradually be eliminated as more people became capable of capital management. In our direct public offerings, over 90% of the investors have never owned shares directly in a business before. Nor do they have an account with a securities broker. Nevertheless, our interviews show that they read the offering documents and perform the same ""risk/reward analysis"" as securities analysts and investment managers.Government intervention was necessary, Lou argued, because vast borrowings were required for workers to invest in businesses. The financial institutions would not extend that credit without government guarantees, tax benefits or other incentives. As to our direct offerings, one of Lou's followers referred to them as a ""Marie Antoinette"" response. (When told the French people could not afford bread, their queen reportedly said: ""Let them eat cake."") The point of the comment being that households don't have money to invest, unless they can get loans that are repaid from the investments' income. However, we have seen that ""workers"" will choose to allocate money to owning shares in a business, rather than spend it on something else. The money is there, if it can be diverted from consumption. Government-supported borrowings are not necessary. (Ironically, Paul Samuelson, Nobel Laureate in Economics, referred to Lou's programs on television's ""60 Minutes"" as: ""It really has a Marie Antoinette-ish ring to it. `Let them own capital!'"")Lou's programs are complex and require professional intermediaries and their advisors. The ESOP and all the other ""_SOPs"" involve creating trusts and intricate financing negotiations and documentation. There is clearly a role for investment bankers and their lawyers. Direct offerings rely on simple structures that have been used for centuries. We have demonstrated that they can be done without these financial engineers and sales forces.These differences do not detract from the benefits that I and many others have gotten from Lou's writings and examples of his theories in action."

She finds that she cannot live in London knowing of the poverty she left behind, and changes her life dramatically when she becomes a relief worker in Nambula, Africa.Things in Nambula, however, are certainly far from idyllic. Rosie finds out that even the best of the camp workers retain their everyday insecurities and ideosyncracies, making life difficult at times. Things take a dramatic turn for the worse when a plague of locusts and influx of refugees threatens to tip the camp of refugees into a famine of the kind not seen since images of Ethiopia flooded television screens.Not recieving help from her employer or the governmental agencies, Rosie puts it all on the line and journies back to London in a mad-dash attempt to solicit the help of the famous club. The celebrities journey to Africa, and see some startling contrasts and yet are surprised by some similarities.The way Fielding portrays both the celebrities and the refugees is brilliant. The scenes are all touched with humor, but are bittersweet as they portray a world in need of attention and help.

Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited,"The great depression in the popular recording industry that began in 1979 still continues. There are signs, however, that the industry is adjusting to new technologies and may soon revive. R. Serge Denisoff documents the decline and possible revival of this comprehensive study of the recording business, a sequel to his widely acclaimed Solid Gold: The Popular Record Industry. Denisoff offers a brief history of popular music and then, in detail, traces the life cycle of a record, beginning with the artist in the studio and following the record until its purchase. He explains the relationships between artist, manager, producer, company, distributor, merchandiser, and media. They all play roles in the scenario of a hit record. He also discusses the new technologies and how they may affect record sales, especially round-the-clock rock and roll on cable television. Tarnished Gold joins Solid Gold as a staple in the popular culture literature.",['R.

Myths To Live By,"""There is no one quite like Joseph Campbell. He knows the vast sweep of man's panoramic past as few men have evern known it."" -The Village Voice What is a properly functioning mythology and what are its functions? Can we use myths to help relieve our modern anxiety, or do they help foster it? In Myths to Live by, Joseph Campbell explores the enduring power of the universal myths that influence our lives daily and examines the myth-making process from the primitive past to the immediate present, retuning always to the source from which all mythology springs: the creative imagination. Campbell stresses that the borders dividing the Earth have been shattered; that myths and religions have always followed the certain basic archetypes and are no longer exclusive to a single people, region, or religion. He shows how we must recognize their common denominators and allow this knowledge to be of use in fulfilling human potential everywhere.",['Joseph Campbell'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fedlS2alp4IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=fedlS2alp4IC&q=Myths+To+Live+By&dq=Myths+To+Live+By&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Penguin Books,1993-02-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=fedlS2alp4IC&dq=Myths+To+Live+By&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],8.0,B000GQV17O,,AHPHL173KB8IU,Jason,7/10,5.0,1014595200,Myths to Live By,"I must admit...I only starting reading this book because Scott Stapp from Creed said he was reading this book and they are my favorite band, but when I starting reading it I couldn't stop.

Captain Blood,,,,,,,,,,1592249264,29.95,A2O5RT4RCC4NU2,Nina M. Osier,3/3,5.0,1162944000,Tremendous fun!,"Peter Blood, an Irish physician recently settled in Bridgewater, England after serving in the Dutch navy, goes out to attend a patient and finds himself thrown into prison for his trouble. Blood's patient was fighting on the Duke of Monmouth's side in rebellion against King James, and that makes Blood equally guilty of treason in the law's eyes. Instead of being sentenced to execution, he's ""lucky"" enough to be shipped off into slavery. In the British colony of Barbados, Colonel Bishop buys him and sets him to work as a physician rather than as a field hand. That gives Blood a great deal easier life, but slavery is still slavery; so he still takes the opportunity for escape when it comes.As a fugitive slave, he cannot return to England. Blood, who served the Dutch as a sea officer in wartime rather than as a ship's surgeon, bases himself in the pirate haven of Tortuga. He's soon known throughout the Caribbean as Captain Blood, the most feared and yet most curiously honorable of pirates. Whose flagship is called the Arabella, which happens to be the given name of his owner Colonel Bishop's niece.I'm told that this novel defined its genre when it was first published, well over 80 years ago. I can well believe this. It's historical fiction solidly researched and accurately written, a rousing adventure tale, and a romance in the best old-fashioned sense of that word, all rolled into one. Tremendous fun to read!"

MUSIC FOR SIGHT SINGING,"The most engaging and musical Sight-Singing text on the market. Music for Sight Singing is structured around organized melodiesdrawn from the literature of composed music and a wide range of the world’s folk music. Real music exercises allow readers to practice sight singing and develop their “mind’s ear” — the ability to imagine how music sounds without first playing it on an instrument. The ninth edition continues to introduce a host of important musical considerations beyond pitch and rhythm- including dynamics, accents, articulations, slurs, repeat signs, and tempo markings. The book’s arrangement of simple to complex exercises lays the foundations for success. Learning Goals Upon completing this book, readers will be able to: Fluently read rhythms in simple and compound meters, including those in relatively unusual, irregular, or changing meter signatures. Sight sing melodies in any major or minor key, and in any diatonic mode. Effortlessly read all four common clefs. Understand common musical symbols and terms. Recognize and sing important harmonic features such as dominant seventh and Neapolitan chords. Improvise effectively from a variety of background structures such as a harmonic progression or an underlying contrapuntal framework. Negotiate chromatic passages from simple embellishing tones and tonicizations to modulations to post-tonal music. NOTE: MySearchLab does not come automatically packaged with this text.

Ottman']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fVIsAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fVIsAAAAQBAJ&dq=MUSIC+FOR+SIGHT+SINGING&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Pearson Higher Ed,2013-01-24,http://books.google.nl/books?id=fVIsAAAAQBAJ&dq=MUSIC+FOR+SIGHT+SINGING&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Music'],,B000NTLSUY,,AUHG8KSHI529U,Craig Matteson,32/36,5.0,1169769600,An excellent resource for developing an essential musical skill,"Typically, music students resist their music theory courses and enjoy the sight singing exercises associated with them even less. My experience as a student and as a teacher leads me to believe that this is usually because by the time the students first get around to learning this skill, they are already confident musicians on their instruments or have learned to sing some other way. To have to learn a new skill from scratch is disturbing and seems unnecessary to them. However, learning to sight sing brings many benefits.Singing music helps one internalize the music more fully. One also develops a greater confidence with pitch than having it done in an instrument. It also helps one learn to sing through one's instrument - that is, to play even more musically. And by developing strategies to sing chromatic music, one has to think through the relationships within the piece. Once the skills are more fully developed, one can learn to come to terms with a new piece of music quite quickly. Therefore, one becomes not only more professional, the whole of one's musical experience deepens.We used the second edition of Ottman's book when I was an undergrad in music in the late seventies and early eighties. This seventh edition is a much richer and more useable book. There are more than a thousand melodies, all nicely arranged to teach something specific. They are actual melodies from the literature rather than some abstract theoretical nothing. And there are lots of rhythmic exercises, so the student can gain skills in becoming more precise in rhythm and especially in rests (you know, letting the silence be silent). A new chapter with melodies from the 20th century is also a nice addition. The new edition also adds some exercises with structured improvisation for the student to experiment with his or her own melodies.The spiral binding actually makes the book more durable and useable. It lays flat on your piano or music stand and the spine won't break and the pages won't be falling out. The print is crisp and clear which makes reading easy. This is important for a book you will be using in your theory courses for several terms.Not only is this great for college students, I think high school and private music teachers would do well by their students to use this as part of their regular music lessons. Their students might fight it a bit (they always seem to), but they will become better musicians and more musical students if they develop the skill to sight sing."
